ABSTRACT The feasibility of one-bit quantization in coast-ship bistatic high-frequency surface-wave
radar (HFSWR) is mainly discussed in order to enjoy the advantages of simplicity, low cost and low power
consumption. Our theoretical derivation shows that the received signal after one-bit quantization can be
expressed as a linear combination of infinite components. These components include the original component
and the high-order components that can be regarded as the interference terms. Then, the variation of the
magnitude of each component with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is given. To reduce the negative impact of
these high-order components on the radar system, the detailed signal forms are analyzed. Furthermore, some
comparative simulations of one-bit quantization and traditional high-precision quantization are provided
to verify the correctness of our theoretical analysis. Both theories and simulation results indicate that
the high-order components can be ignored in coast-ship bistatic HFSWR and that one-bit quantization is
effective. Finally, real data analysis also validates the efficiency of one-bit quantization in practice.

I. INTRODUCTION

The coast-ship bistatic high-frequency surface-wave radar
(HFSWR) has been capable of playing the irreplaceable
role in monitoring the sea surface state and tracking targets
with the virtues of low cost and the ability of operation in
all weathers [1]. And the coast-ship bistatic HFSWR combines the benefits of high-frequency radar and bistatic radar.
Since the receiving station does not radiate energy, the coastship bistatic HFSWR has better performance in flexibility,
maneuverability and the ability to provide long early warning
time [2], [3]. Inspired by the synthetic impulse and aperture
radar (SIAR) [4], [5], a novel coast-ship bistatic HFSWR with
multiple carrier frequencies has been proposed in [6], [7].
The radar system in [6], [7] employs an array mounted
on the coast to simultaneously transmit a set of orthogonal
waveforms, and an omni-antenna on a ship to receive echo
signals. Thus, this radar system is similar to multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) radar [8]. By proper processing,
an equivalent transmitting pattern is formed with a reception
antenna [9].

The most significant advantage of the radar system in [9]
is that plenty of ships could share a common transmitting
array. There are two potential applications. One is that in the
civilian field, a large number of fishing boats can be warned of
surrounding non-cooperative dangerous targets, e.g. pirates.
The other one is that in the military field, a large number of
unmanned boats with small size perform detection jointly in a
area close to the enemy targets. The coming challenge is how
to reduce equipment costs. Recently, a low-cost radar technology, one-bit quantization technology, has emerged [10], [11].
One-bit quantization refers to a one-bit analog-to-digital Converter. Traditional ADCs have many bits in order to make the
signal undistorted. For one-bit quantization, only one bit is
used to represent the signal amplitude at a certain time, which
means that expensive high-precision ADCs can be replaced
with cheaper comparators. And the following advantages can
be achieved by one-bit quantization technology. (1) Low cost
and low power consumption are conducive to miniaturization
of equipment. (2) Comparator is easy to achieve higher rate
sampling. (3) One-bit quantized data is beneficial to store and
process.
In [12]–[15], processing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
data coded with one-bit was considered. First of all, basic

processing in SAR, pulse compression or convolution operation, was discussed in detail in spectrum analysis, computation burden, and data storage [12]. Results in [12] show that
time-domain convolution between binary sequences allows
a mass storage saving with respect to the conventional convolution performed via Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), and
in several cases also a time saving. Most importantly, when
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, the matched filter is
still effective. Next, the information of SAR raw signal can be
restored from the one-bit quantized signal and the image does
not exhibit any appreciable degradation [13], [14]. In [15],
a SAR platform using one-bit quantization processed binary
data in real time with simple, small low-cost and low-power
devices.
The effects of one-bit quantization on the direction-ofarrival (DOA) estimation accuracy have also been analyzed
in [16]. The corresponding one-bit Cramér-Rao bound (CRB)
for a two-sensor array has been derived. Numerical results
in [16] show that using one-bit quantization may be an elegant
choice for DOA systems and can provide reasonable practical
accuracy. However, in essence, one-bit quantization does lose
some information and introduce new interferences. In order
to get better estimation accuracy, some novel DOA estimation
methods have been introduced [17]–[19], such as support
vector machine (SVM) based method [17], binary iterative
hard thresholding (BIHT) method [18] and Sparse Bayesian
Learning (SBL) based method [19]. Classical subspace-based
methods, such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC),
have been verified to be straightforwardly applied without
extra pre-processing [20]. In addition, it is shown in [21]
that sparse arrays (nested and coprime arrays) are more
robust to the deleterious effects of one-bit quantization,
compared to uniform linear arrays (ULAs). For 5G wireless communication system, one-bit ADC has been widely
studied in channel estimation, DOA estimation and system
performance [22], [23].
Recently, one-bit quantization has once again attracted
considerable research interest in radar [10], [24]–[26].
In [10], the conventional radar measurement scheme is
replaced by the one-bit sampling with Gaussian and uniform
dithering. The one-bit samples can be efficiently processed
by using conventional methods proposed for high-precision
samples. Sampling with dithering is also known as sampling
with time-varying thresholds in [24]–[26]. The problem of
sparse parameter estimation with one-bit quantization was
considered in [24]. And the CRB for parameters of the single
sinusoidal case was computed for a variety of parameter
values [25]. Also for one-bit sampling with time-varying
thresholds in [26], the target estimation is formulated as
a multivariate weighted-least-squares optimization problem
that can be solved in a cyclic manner. In [11], one-bit linear
frequency modulated continuous wave (LFMCW) radar was
studied and a two-stage target detection approach termed
as dimension reduction generalized-approximate-messagepassing (DR-GAMP) was proposed. It is worth noting that
in [10], [11], [24]–[26], there is a common interesting

phenomenon: for one-bit quantization, higher SNR does not
necessarily lead to better parameter estimation performance.
Essentially, the fewer the number of quantization bits,
the more distortion the signal has. A natural question is: as an
extremely low precision quantization, can one-bit quantization ensure that the information is not lost and the parameter
measurement function of coast-ship bistatic HFSWR is not
affected? The main goal of this study will answer the question
and the main contributions are summarized as follows:
(1) The components of the received one-bit signal in
coast-ship bistatic HFSWR are analyzed. One-bit quantization will result in additional high-order components.
The variations of these components with respect to SNR
are given. It can be found that the lower the SNR,
the larger the difference between the average amplitudes of the high-order components and the original
components.
(2) The signal forms of high-order components are analyzed. High-order components with different slopes,
Doppler information, and distance information from the
original component cannot be accumulated in traditional
signal processing (e.g. pulse compression, beamforming, and coherent integration).
(3) The feasibility of one-bit in the coast-ship bistatic
HFSWR is verified by numerical simulations and
analysis of measured data. Traditional processing
methods in the coast-ship bistatic HFSWR are verified to be straightforwardly applied. Compared with
high-precision quantization, one-bit quantization has
almost no loss. Therefore, one-bit quantization has great
potential in the coast-ship bistatic HFSWR.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
an overview of the coast-ship bistatic HFSWR system and
signal model are introduced. In Section III, the components of
the received one-bit signal are analyzed. Then, multi-carrier
frequency LFMICW signal processing is developed and
detailed in Section IV. Simulation results are provided in
Section V, and the measured data is analyzed in Section VI.
This paper is concluded in Section VII.

The geometry of the coast-ship bistatic HFSWR system is
illustrated in Fig. 1. The transmitting array (Tx) of the radar

is a uniform linear array with K antennas, which is placed
along the coast. And the receiver system (Rx) with a single
antenna is mounted on the boat. The frequency-modulated
interruptive continuous waves (FMICW) with multiple
carrier frequencies are adopted. The carrier frequencies of transmitting antennas are different from each
other, which ensures the orthogonality of the transmitted
waveform.
The receiver architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2. Different from high-precision ADCs used in conventional
coast-ship bistatic HFSWR, one-bit ADCs are used here.
The received signals are filtered, amplified at a low noise
level, and sampled at intermediate frequency (IF) by the
one-bit ADCs. Other signal processing procedures are
consistent with that of the conventional coast-ship bistatic
HFSWR with high-precision ADCs. The sampled signals are
mixed with the multiple reference signals with the carrier
frequencies corresponding to the transmit antennas, and separated through a low-pass filtered (LPF) individually, which
is co-called channel separation. After the fast Fourier transform (FFT), i.e., range transforming, the output signal of
each channel is obtained. The equivalent transmit beampatterns can be obtained by transmitter synthesis processing. In
order to significantly improve target detection performance,
it is necessary to perform the coherent integration. Then,
we obtain the three basic parameters of target: distance, direction, and speed.
Assuming that fc is the carrier frequency, the transmitted
signal in one sweep period can be expressed by

targets.

III. ANALYSIS OF ONE-BIT QUANTIZED SIGNAL
A. SIGNAL ANALYSIS FOR ONE TARGET

Without loss of generality, the real part of the received one-bit
signal is analyzed. We first consider a segment of the received
signal when there is only one target, e.g. the segment where
target A is located as shown in Fig. 3. The echo of this
target does not overlap with other target echoes, which is the
simplest case.
The real part of the received one-bit signal can be expressed

in [10]. For K > 2, it is difficult to obtain a closed solution
of (9). However, we could use Matlab software to calculate

Fig. 4 shows the variation of the main components (m =
1, 3, 5) with SNR after one-bit quantization for arrays with
different numbers of antennas. The legends ’1’, ’3’, ’5’
in Fig. 4 (a) represent the components < 1 >, < 3 >
and < 5 > respectively. In Fig. 4 (b), ’1-1-1’ means that
three of {mk,1 }K
k=1 are 1, and the rest are 0. ’2-3’ represents
the component < m1,1 ,··· ,mK ,1 > that one of {mk,1 }K
k=1 is 2,
one is 3, and the rest are 0. By analogy, the meaning of other
legends can be derived.
It can be seen from Fig. 4 (b-d) that for components with
the same order m, the curves of the amplitude (dB) as a

function of SNR are parallel to each other at a low SNR (dB).
In Fig. 4, the solid lines, the dashed lines, and the dotted lines
represent first-order, third-order, and fifth-order components,
respectively. And the larger the order m, the smaller the
component amplitude. And the larger the order m, the smaller
the component amplitude. Therefore, there is no further discussion of the components with a large order (m > 3). For
regions with low SNR, the amplitude difference between
the original component (m = 1) and the high-order component is large. As SNR increases, all components tend to
be flat, and the magnitudes of the high-order components
are close to the magnitude of the original component. This
phenomenon tells us that one-bit quantization can work well
in the case of low SNR, and well explain that the presence of ’ghost scatterers’ tend to disappear as the noise
level is increased in [12], and can also explain that the
one-bit Gaussian dithered samples can be processed efficiently by using the conventional algorithm proposed for the
infinite precision samples when noise is sufficiently large
in [10].
Fig. 5 shows the average amplitude difference between the
original component and the maximum high-order component.
When SNR = −20 dB, the maximum high-order component
is already 45 dB smaller than the original component.

FIGURE 5. Average amplitude difference between the original
component and the maximum higher-order component.

For a clearer understanding of high-order components,
Fig. 6 shows the time-frequency relationship of one-bit quantized signals with SNR = 10, −5 dB when K = 1. For
K = 1, we know from (7) that the possible components
are cos 8i,1 , cos 38i,1 , and cos 58i,1 . Their imaginary parts
can be written as cos(8i,1 − π/2), cos(38i,1 − 3π/2), and
cos(58i,1 − 5π/2), and their complex forms can be written

as exp(j8i,1 ), exp(−j38i,1 ), and exp(j58i,1 ). In Fig. 6 (a),
the original component has the highest amplitude. The sweep
rate of the 3-order component is negative. The sweep rate of
the 5-order component is positive, and due to the limitation
of the sampling frequency, the spectrum has an ambiguity
phenomenon. The SNR in Fig. 6 (b) is lower, and only the
original component can be observed. For K = 4, Fig. 7
shows similar results to Fig. 6, except for the more complex
high-order components.
In addition, the bandwidths of the high-order components
are broadened. The influence of the high-order components
on the original components can be further reduced in traditional processing. Taking the 3-order component as an
example, the signal forms of the possible components are as
follows:
cos 38i,1 cos 28i,1 cos 8j,1 cos 8i,1 cos 8j,1 cos 8k,1
(1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ K ) (13)
Using the trigonometric identities, the above components
(13) can be decomposed into the following components:
const, cos 8i,1 , cos 38i,1 , cos(28i,1 ± 8j,1 ),
cos(±8i,1 ± 8j,1 ± 8k,1 ) (1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ K )

In summary, the one-bit quantized signal for one target can
be processed efficiently by using the conventional algorithm
proposed for the infinite precision samples.
B. SIGNAL ANALYSIS FOR TWO OR MORE TARGETS

For multiple targets, the one-bit quantized signal has more
complex high-order cross-components. It is assumed that
echoes of multiple targets overlap over a certain period of
time, e.g., in Fig. 3, the segment where target B and target
C are located.
When the equation (7) is extended to P(P > 1) targets,
the real part of the one-bit signal can be expressed as

According to the analysis in Fig. 4, the magnitudes of the
5-order components are much smaller than the magnitudes
of the 3-order components. Therefore, we only analyze the
3-order components. When P = 2, the 3-order components
can be divided into the following three categories:
(1) Self-components of the first target.
cos 38i,1 , cos 28i,1 cos 8j,1 , cos 8i,1 cos 8j,1 cos 8k,1

cos 8i,1 cos 8j,1 cos 8k,2 , cos 8i,1 cos 8j,2 cos 8k,2 .
(21)
Fig. 8 shows the average magnitudes of the components of
the two targets as a function of the SNR of target 1. Here,
the number of array elements K is 8, and the SNR of the
target 2 is set as a constant at -35 dB.
55584

FIGURE 9. The average amplitude of different components of two targets
when the SNR of target 2 is constant at 20 dB.

It can be seen that the average amplitude variation of
components of target 1 coincides with the average amplitude
variation of the component of the single target in Fig. 4 (c). As
shown by the solid blue line in Fig 8, the average amplitude of
the original component of target 2 remains unchanged as the
SNR of target 1 increases when the SNR of target 1 is smaller
than −10 dB, but decreases as the SNR of target 1 increases
further. It is worth noting that the original component of target 1 gradually approaches the 3-order components of target 2
when the SNR of target 1 is smaller than −60 dB. However, the 3-order self-components of target 2, as described in
Section III-A, will not affect traditional processing.
The cross-components of two targets (gray dashed line)
always maintain a large gap with the original component
of the target 1. At low SNR less than -35 dB, the crosscomponent with the largest amplitude is parallel to the original component of target 1. When the SNR of target 1 is greater
than -35dB, the cross-components will gradually approach
the original components.
When the SNR of target 2 is 20 dB, the amplitudes of
the components of the two targets varies with the SNR of
target 1 as shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the amplitude of original components of target 1 are smaller than the

self-components of target 2. According to the analysis in
Section III-A, the high-order self-components of target 2 can
be suppressed by range transforming. Then, we analyze the
cross-components. The signal form of the cross-component
with the highest amplitude in Fig. 9 can be described
by
cos 8i,1 cos 28j,2
= cos(8i,1 + 28j,2 ) + cos(8i,1 − 28j,2 )
= cos{2π(fi + 2fj )t + 2π(fi (di sin θ1 /c − τ1 )
+ 2fj (dj sin θ2 /c + 2τ2 )) + 3πµt 2 − 2πµt(τ1 + 2τ2 )
(1)

(2)

+ 2π(fd + 2fd )nT + (ψ1 + 2ψ2 ) + πµ(τ12 + 2τ22 )}
+ cos{2π(fi − 2fj )t + 2π(fi (di sin θ1 /c − τ1 )
− 2fj (dj sin θ2 /c + 2τ2 )) + πµt 2 − 2πµt(τ1 − 2τ2 )
(1)

(2)

+ 2π(fd − 2fd )nT + (ψ1 − 2ψ2 ) + πµ(τ12 − 2τ22 )}
(22)
The sweep rate of the first term of (22) is 3µ, thus this term
can be ignored in range transforming. And the complex form
of the second term of (22) can be written as
cos(8i,1 − 28j,2 )
+ j cos((8i,1 − π/2) − 2(8j,2 − π/2))
= exp{j(28j,2 − 8i,1 )}
= exp{j2π(2fj − fi )t + j2π(2fj (dj sin θ2 /c + 2τ2 )
− fi (di sin θ1 /c − τ1 )) − πµt 2 − 2πµt(2τ2 − τ1 )
(2)

(1)

+2π(2fd − fd )nT + (2ψ2 − ψ1 ) + πµ(τ12 − 2τ22 )}
(23)
The above equation means that a false target with a Doppler
(2)
(1)
frequency of (2fd − fd ) will appear at (t = 2τ2 − τ1 ), and
the angle of this false target cannot be determined from the
angle term j2π(2fj (dj sin θ2 /c + 2τ2 ) − fi (di sin θ1 /c − τ1 )).
Simulations in Section V-C will verify the correctness of this
analysis.
For bistatic HFSWR, the direct-path-interference (DPI)
can be regarded as a very powerful target with high SNR [9].
If the DPI is not removed completely, the range sidelobes of
the DPI will block other targets and the high-order components generated by one-bit quantization will result in false
targets. Fortunately, the DPI can be regarded as a target with a
high SNR, which allows us to use the traditional method [9] to
obtain the precise reference signals and accurately eliminate
it.
For multiple targets, high-order components can still be
divided into self-components and cross-components. The
self-components have the same amplitude distribution as that
with only one target in Fig. 4. And the cross-components
always have smaller amplitudes than all original components.
Their amplitude difference will increase with the decrease of
SNR. Therefore, all high-order components can be ignored
for coast-ship bistatic HFSWR in an appropriate SNR.
VOLUME 8, 2020

C. SNR IN THE COAST-SHIP BISTATIC HFSWR

We have analyzed the average amplitudes of all components,
and we can get a preliminary conclusion that the impact
of high-order components can be ignored in a small SNR.
However, how small are the SNRs of the targets?
From Fig. 8 and 9, it can be concluded that the high-order
cross-components are smaller than the high-order selfcomponent with the highest amplitude (the dotted line is
always under the red or blue dashed line). And the amplitude
difference between the original component and the maximum
high-order self-component is shown in Fig. 5. We assume that
the high-order components can be considered to be negligible
when the amplitude difference between the original component and the maximum high-order self-component is at least
a given value (e.g. 45dB). At this time, the maximum SNR
(−20dB) of targets can be determined by the lines in Fig. 5.
The coast-ship bistatic HFSWR has two characteristics.
One is the low range resolution, which facilitates long-term
coherent integration. The other is employing FMICW, which
leads to a high gain of pulse compression. This means that the
signal processing gain is high, and the SNR of the target without signal processing can be very low under the given SNR of
the target detection. For example, assuming that improvement
of SNR in pulse synthesis (the number of the antennas) is
K = 16, the frequency space is 1kHz, the sampling point
during the sweep period (T = 0.5s) is 0.5s ·16kHz = 8000,
and the number of coherent integration is 128, the total SNR
gain of signal processing is 16 × 8000 × 128 = 72dB. If the
SNR of the target detection is set to 15dB, the SNR of the
unprocessed signal (12) is approximately 15-72 = −57dB.
At this time, the high-order components is at least 100dB less
than the original component as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore,
most targets in the coast-ship bistatic HFSWR meet the application conditions of one-bit quantization.
In summary, there are three reasons why high-order components can be ignored or why one-bit quantization can be
applied.
All types of signals after one-bit quantization bring additional high-order components with lower amplitude. The
amplitude differences between the original components
and high-order components will increase with the decrement of SNR. Fortunately, unprocessed radar signals
generally have a lower SNR.
• With different bandwidth and signal forms from original
components, high-order components will be suppressed
in the time domain (pulse compression), spatial domain
(beamforming), and Doppler domain (coherent integration).
• False targets only appear when the SNR is high, which
is rare especially when the DPI is removed.
•

IV. MULTI-CARRIER FREQUENCY LFMICW SIGNAL
PROCESSING

The DPI can be directly set to zero in the time domain,
which can eliminate the influence of high-order components

fundamentally. In addition, it is the DPI that we use to extract
the reference signals and complete the synthesis processing.
Details on DPI removal and synthesis processing have been
given in [9].
According to the previous analysis, we can ignore the
high-order components. The one-bit quantized signal (3) can
be approximated as

where n represents the index of the sweep period and Ãp represents the amplitude of the original component after one-bit

respect to the time. Therefore, in order to obtain the parameters of the target, coordinate transformation is also required.
In this paper, coordinate transformation is the same as that
in [6], [9]. We will not discuss it in detail.
V. SIMULATION

In this section, some comparative experiments of one-bit
quantization and traditional high-precision quantization
to demonstrate the feasibility of one-bit quantization in
coast-ship bistatic HFSWR. In all of the following simulations, it is assumed that the transmitting array is ULA
with 16 antennas (K = 16), the carrier frequency fc =
6.75MHz, the sweep bandwidth B = 60kHz, 1f = 1kHz,
the sweep period T = 0.45s, Tr = 3ms, Te = 1ms,
M = 64, and the noise power 2σw2 is 1. It is known from the
references [7] that the range-azimuth coupling is serious
when using sequential carrier frequency distribution. In order
to suppress the range-azimuth coupling, we use the optimization method in [7] to obtain the optimal carrier frequencies of
antennas:
{−2.5, 0.5, 6.5, −0.5, 4.5, 3.5, −7.5, −5.5,

Finally, the coherent integration over N number of sweep

It needs to be emphasized again that θp denotes the direction of target respect to the transmit array, that the time delay
τp = (RT,p + RR,p )/c is determined by the sum of the
distance from the transmitting array to the pth target and
the distance from the pth target to the receiving array, and
(p)
that fd is proportional to the derivative of (RT,p + RR,p )

A. SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR ONE TARGET

In this example, we consider the case of only one target. This
target with SNR of -25 dB and radial velocity of 26.67 m/s
is located at the range-azimuth position (320km, 10◦ ).
Fig. 10 and 11 show the processing results of high-precision
quantization and one-bit quantization. Fig. 10 (a), (b) and (c)
show the range-azimuth profile, Doppler-azimuth profile, and
Doppler-range profile using the traditional high-precision
quantization. Correspondingly, the processing results using
one-bit quantization are shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen
that the peaks of both results are at the same location.
For ease of comparison, Fig. 12 (a), (b) and (c) show the
results of one-dimensional processing on range, azimuth,
and Doppler frequency. In each dimension, the sidelobes
for one-bit quantization and high-precision quantization are
approximately consistent. As expected, large peaks exist
at the position corresponding to target range, azimuth and
Doppler frequency. In the result of one-bit quantization,
the most worrying false target did not appear. This means that
at low SNR, high-order components are negligible after signal
processing.
B. SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR MULTIPLE TARGETS

We consider multiple targets in this experiment, and the
parameters of targets are given in Table 1. Here, we assume
that all targets are in the same Doppler channel. Fig. 13
shows the range-azimuth profile of one-bit quantization and
high-precision quantization. The target positions of the two
quantization methods are the same.

C. FALSE TARGET

subsection is only to prove the correctness of our theoretical
analysis.
The SNR, azimuth, range, and radial velocity of the first
target are set to 0dB, −20◦ , 200km, 0.22 m/s, respectively.
The other target with SNR of 10 dB and radial velocity
of 0 m/s is located at the range-azimuth position (230km,
30◦ ). The Doppler frequencies of the two targets are 0Hz,

In order to verify the correctness of the analysis on the
false targets generated by the cross-components, the case
of two targets with high SNR is considered. Our analysis
in Section III shows that the false targets will only exist
in the case of high SNR, and that the SNR of the coast
bistatic HFSWR is generally low. Thus, the simulation in this

the conclusion in Section III-B that the false target appears at
(230 × 2 − 200 = 260) km.
As analyzed in Section III-C, the SNRs of targets
in the coast-ship bistatic HFSWR are usually very low
(SNR0dB). As a result, false targets will hardly appear
in the coast-ship bistatic HFSWR. In the next section, some
measured data will confirm this.
VI. MEASURED DATA VALIDATION

0.01Hz, thus they are all in the first Doppler channel. The
echoes of the two targets overlap by 90%.
Fig. 14 shows the range-azimuth profile of the first Doppler
channel. It can be seen that the processing result of one-bit
quantization has a false target at 260 km. This result supports
55588

In order to verify the effect of one-bit quantization in practice, some measured data collected from a coast-ship bistatic
HFSWR are analyzed. This radar system using 14-bit quantization has been introduced in [6], [9]. The transmit array
of this radar consist of 8 individual three-element Yagi-Uda

antennas as shown in Fig. 15. The Yagi-Uda antenna is composed of 3 elements, a guiding antenna, an active antenna, and
a reflecting antenna. Fig. 16 shows the receive antenna placed
on a moving boat, which is an isotropic vertical monopole.
The carrier frequency fc = 6.75MHz, the sweep bandwidth
VOLUME 8, 2020

B = 60kHz, 1f = 3.75kHz, and the sweep period T = 0.5s,
Tr = 1ms, Te = 300µ s.
For comparison, one-bit quantized data is obtained
by one-bit resampling of high-precision quantized data.
Fig. 17 (a) shows 14-bit quantized data of three sub-pulses.
Fig. 17 (b) is the corresponding one-bit quantized data. We
can see that the DPI is very clear and its SNR is much greater
than 0 dB.
Since the gain of coherent integration in this radar system
is much larger than that of synthesis processing, the coherent
integration may be prior to synthesis processing (equivalent
transmit beamforming). The range-Doppler profile in the first
channel is shown in Fig. 18. The results for the other 7 channels are similar to Fig. 18 and are not given here. The number
of coherent integration is 512, i.e., the integration time is
512 × 0.5 = 256 s. It can be seen from Fig. 18 (a) and (b)
that we obtain similar results including sea clutter and several non-cooperative targets. These targets are passing ships
on the sea. The slices of the synthesis processing in the
range-Doppler units of the four distinct targets are shown in
55589

FIGURE 20. Implementation of multiplication of one-bit signal.

Two advantages can be obtained by using one bit quantization in this radar system: reduced data storage and reduced
computation of signal processing. In the original radar system, the 14-bit ADC was used and the storage type was 16-bit
signed integer. If one-bit quantization is used, the data storage
is reduced by a factor of 16. In Fig. 2, the multiplication
operation involved in channel separation can be converted
into the XNOR operation. As shown in Fig. 20, we perform
the XNOR operation on the sign bit of the reference signal
and the one-bit quantized data to obtain a new sign bit, and
then recombine the new sign bit with the data bits of the
reference signal to obtain the product of the reference signal
and the one-bit quantized signal.

Obviously, the accuracy of one-bit quantized data can be
comparable to that of high-precision quantized data.

VII. CONCLUSION

We introduce one-bit quantization into coast-ship bistatic
HFSWR to gain many advantages of one-bit quantization,
such as low cost and low power consumption. Our theoretical
analysis shows that one-bit quantization does not completely
distort the original signal, but retains the original component while introducing other high-order components. The
magnitudes of these high-order components are generally
smaller than that of the original components. After pulse
compression, the influence of these high-order components
will be further reduced. Numerical simulations and analysis
of measured data show that traditional processing methods in
the coast-ship bistatic HFSWR are verified to be straightforwardly applied.
In addition, all radars have an important process, pulse
compression, which can accumulate the original components
and filter out the high-order components, then reduce the
adverse impact of one-bit quantization. Even at high SNR,
as long as the transmitting waveform and matched filter are
properly designed, the influence of high-order components
can be reduced. Thus, we will extend one-bit quantization to
other radars and our future work will focus on the design of
the transmitted waveform and pulse filter to reduce the impact
of high-order components caused by one-bit quantization.
