I DIDN\u2019T WANT TO BE A HALF-BLOOD.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is:\nclose this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you\nabout your birth, and try to lead a normal life.\nBeing a half-blood is dangerous. It\u2019s scary. Most of the time, it gets you\nkilled in painful, nasty ways.\nIf you\u2019re a normal kid, reading this because you think it\u2019s fiction, great.\nRead on. I envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever\nhappened.\nBut if you recognize yourself in these pages\u2014if you feel something\nstirring inside\u2014stop reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once\nyou know that, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they sense it too, and they\u2019ll\ncome for you.\nDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\nMy name is Percy Jackson.\nI\u2019m twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at\nYancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York.\nAm I a troubled kid?\n\n\fYeah. You could say that.\nI could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it, but things\nreally started going bad last May, when our sixth-grade class took a field trip\nto Manhattan\u2014twenty-eight mental-case kids and two teachers on a yellow\nschool bus, heading to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at ancient\nGreek and Roman stuff.\nI know\u2014it sounds like torture. Most Yancy field trips were.\nBut Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes.\nMr. Brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair. He had\nthinning hair and a scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket, which always\nsmelled like coffee. You wouldn\u2019t think he\u2019d be cool, but he told stories and\njoked and let us play games in class. He also had this awesome collection of\nRoman armor and weapons, so he was the only teacher whose class didn\u2019t\nput me to sleep.\nI hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn\u2019t\nget in trouble.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 3440, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acc0915f-50db-42c2-827b-55ec91debb0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "acc0915f-50db-42c2-827b-55ec91debb0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1bd2625e-6ec1-4d52-86b3-1951a465423b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "f8bed8190f0a13ce0a1ecbd346346e996bed6c5617894010cbc0d29966ecd934", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a0c09bd-f495-45ad-80d9-1fe38e275f97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d97eb54cc06a56e4393a50319981af9414b724fa9fa13b4ff6ea8686243f5fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I know\u2014it sounds like torture.

At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn\u2019t\nget in trouble.\nBoy, was I wrong.\nSee, bad things happen to me on field trips. Like at my fifth-grade\nschool, when we went to the Saratoga battlefield, I had this accident with a\nRevolutionary War cannon. I wasn\u2019t aiming for the school bus, but of course\nI got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school, when we\ntook a behind-the-scenes tour of the Marine World shark pool, I sort of hit\nthe wrong lever on the catwalk and our class took an unplanned swim. And\nthe time before that\u2026Well, you get the idea.\nThis trip, I was determined to be good.\nAll the way into the city, I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the freckly,\nredheaded kleptomaniac girl, hitting my friend Grover in the back of the\nhead with chunks of peanut-butter-and-ketchup sandwich.\nGrover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got\nfrustrated. He must\u2019ve been held back several grades, because he was the\nonly sixth grader with acne and the start of a wispy beard on his chin. On top\nof all that, he was crippled. He had a note excusing him from PE for the rest\nof his life because he had some kind of muscular disease in his legs. He\nwalked funny, like every step hurt him, but don\u2019t let that fool you. You\nshould\u2019ve seen him run when it was enchilada day in the cafeteria.\nAnyway, Nancy Bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his\ncurly brown hair, and she knew I couldn\u2019t do anything back to her because I\n\n\fwas already on probation. The headmaster had threatened me with death by\nin-school suspension if anything bad, embarrassing, or even mildly\nentertaining happened on this trip.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill her,\u201d I mumbled.\nGrover tried to calm me down. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I like peanut butter.\u201d\nHe dodged another piece of Nancy\u2019s lunch.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d I started to get up, but Grover pulled me back to my seat.\n\u201cYou\u2019re already on probation,\u201d he reminded me. \u201cYou know who\u2019ll get\nblamed if anything happens.\u201d\nLooking back on it, I wish I\u2019d decked Nancy Bobofit right then and\nthere. In-school suspension would\u2019ve been nothing compared to the mess I\nwas about to get myself into.\nMr. Brunner led the museum tour.\n\n\fHe rode up front in his wheelchair, guiding us through the big echoey\ngalleries, past marble statues and glass cases full of really old black-andorange pottery.\nIt blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand, three\nthousand years.\nHe gathered us around a thirteen-foot-tall stone column with a big sphinx\non the top, and started telling us how it was a grave marker, a stele, for a girl\nabout our age. He told us about the carvings on the sides. I was trying to\nlisten to what he had to say, because it was kind of interesting, but\n\n\feverybody around me was talking, and every time I told them to shut up, the\nother teacher chaperone, Mrs. Dodds, would give me the evil eye.\n\n\f\fMrs. Dodds was this little math teacher from Georgia who always wore a\nblack leather jacket, even though she was fifty years old. She looked mean\nenough to ride a Harley right into your locker. She had come to Yancy\nhalfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a nervous\nbreakdown.\nFrom her first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was\ndevil spawn.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2827, "end_char_idx": 6603, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a0c09bd-f495-45ad-80d9-1fe38e275f97": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a0c09bd-f495-45ad-80d9-1fe38e275f97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "acc0915f-50db-42c2-827b-55ec91debb0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "556be6e6e67ac8675a39a85a8603f42f57b98d1362fd79a2a5569d7059e1bcfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78346d42-3c4b-4bae-a0df-cd337be45d8a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b0aad3d40c071e903eeb120678625679c8b24445211aa7f313ac71e32097fef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He told us about the carvings on the sides.

She looked mean\nenough to ride a Harley right into your locker. She had come to Yancy\nhalfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a nervous\nbreakdown.\nFrom her first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was\ndevil spawn. She would point her crooked finger at me and say, \u201cNow,\nhoney,\u201d real sweet, and I knew I was going to get after-school detention for a\nmonth.\nOne time, after she\u2019d made me erase answers out of old math workbooks\nuntil midnight, I told Grover I didn\u2019t think Mrs. Dodds was human. He\nlooked at me, real serious, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d\nMr. Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art.\nFinally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the\nstele, and I turned around and said, \u201cWill you shut up?\u201d\nIt came out louder than I meant it to.\nThe whole group laughed. Mr. Brunner stopped his story.\n\u201cMr. Jackson,\u201d he said, \u201cdid you have a comment?\u201d\nMy face was totally red. I said, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\nMr. Brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll\ntell us what this picture represents?\u201d\nI looked at the carving, and felt a flush of relief, because I actually\nrecognized it. \u201cThat\u2019s Kronos eating his kids, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Brunner said, obviously not satisfied. \u201cAnd he did this\nbecause\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d I racked my brain to remember. \u201cKronos was the king god, and\n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGod?\u201d Mr. Brunner asked.\n\u201cTitan,\u201d I corrected myself. \u201cAnd\u2026he didn\u2019t trust his kids, who were the\ngods. So, um, Kronos ate them, right? But his wife hid baby Zeus, and gave\nKronos a rock to eat instead. And later, when Zeus grew up, he tricked his\ndad, Kronos, into barfing up his brothers and sisters\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEeew!\u201d said one of the girls behind me.\n\u201c\u2014and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,\u201d I\ncontinued, \u201cand the gods won.\u201d\nSome snickers from the group.\n\n\fBehind me, Nancy Bobofit mumbled to a friend, \u201cLike we\u2019re going to\nuse this in real life. Like it\u2019s going to say on our job applications, \u2018Please\nexplain why Kronos ate his kids.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnd why, Mr. Jackson,\u201d Brunner said, \u201cto paraphrase Miss Bobofit\u2019s\nexcellent question, does this matter in real life?\u201d\n\u201cBusted,\u201d Grover muttered.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Nancy hissed, her face even brighter red than her hair.\nAt least Nancy got packed, too. Mr. Brunner was the only one who ever\ncaught her saying anything wrong. He had radar ears.\nI thought about his question, and shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Mr. Brunner looked disappointed. \u201cWell, half credit, Mr.\nJackson. Zeus did indeed feed Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine, which\nmade him disgorge his other five children, who, of course, being immortal\ngods, had been living and growing up completely undigested in the Titan\u2019s\nstomach. The gods defeated their father, sliced him to pieces with his own\nscythe, and scattered his remains in Tartarus, the darkest part of the\nUnderworld. On that happy note, it\u2019s time for lunch. Mrs. Dodds, would you\nlead us back outside?\u201d\nThe class drifted off, the girls holding their stomachs, the guys pushing\neach other around and acting like doofuses.\nGrover and I were about to follow when Mr. Brunner said, \u201cMr.\nJackson.\u201d\nI knew that was coming.\nI told Grover to keep going.

And how your studies apply to it.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you learn from me,\u201d he said, \u201cis vitally important. I expect you to\ntreat it as such. I will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson.\u201d\nI wanted to get angry, this guy pushed me so hard.\nI mean, sure, it was kind of cool on tournament days, when he dressed up\nin a suit of Roman armor and shouted: \u201cWhat ho!\u201d and challenged us,\nsword-point against chalk, to run to the board and name every Greek and\nRoman person who had ever lived, and their mother, and what god they\n\n\fworshipped. But Mr. Brunner expected me to be as good as everybody else,\ndespite the fact that I have dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and I had\nnever made above a C- in my life. No\u2014he didn\u2019t expect me to be as good;\nhe expected me to be better. And I just couldn\u2019t learn all those names and\nfacts, much less spell them correctly.\nI mumbled something about trying harder, while Mr. Brunner took one\nlong sad look at the stele, like he\u2019d been at this girl\u2019s funeral.\nHe told me to go outside and eat my lunch.\nThe class gathered on the front steps of the museum, where we could watch\nthe foot traffic along Fifth Avenue.\nOverhead, a huge storm was brewing, with clouds blacker than I\u2019d ever\nseen over the city. I figured maybe it was global warming or something,\nbecause the weather all across New York state had been weird since\nChristmas. We\u2019d had massive snow storms, flooding, wildfires from\nlightning strikes. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if this was a hurricane\nblowing in.\nNobody else seemed to notice. Some of the guys were pelting pigeons\nwith Lunchables crackers. Nancy Bobofit was trying to pickpocket\nsomething from a lady\u2019s purse, and, of course, Mrs. Dodds wasn\u2019t seeing a\nthing.\nGrover and I sat on the edge of the fountain, away from the others. We\nthought that maybe if we did that, everybody wouldn\u2019t know we were from\nthat school\u2014the school for loser freaks who couldn\u2019t make it elsewhere.\n\n\f\u201cDetention?\u201d Grover asked.\n\u201cNah,\u201d I said. \u201cNot from Brunner. I just wish he\u2019d lay off me sometimes.\nI mean\u2014I\u2019m not a genius.\u201d\nGrover didn\u2019t say anything for a while. Then, when I thought he was\ngoing to give me some deep philosophical comment to make me feel better,\nhe said, \u201cCan I have your apple?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, so I let him take it.\nI watched the stream of cabs going down Fifth Avenue, and thought\nabout my mom\u2019s apartment, only a little ways uptown from where we sat.

I wasn\u2019t even sure what it meant, but it sounded good.\nThe headmaster sent my mom a letter the following week, making it\nofficial: I would not be invited back next year to Yancy Academy,\nFine, I told myself. Just fine.\nI was homesick.\nI wanted to be with my mom in our little apartment on the Upper East\nSide, even if I had to go to public school and put up with my obnoxious\nstepfather and his stupid poker parties.\nAnd yet\u2026there were things I\u2019d miss at Yancy. The view of the woods\nout my dorm window, the Hudson River in the distance, the smell of pine\ntrees. I\u2019d miss Grover, who\u2019d been a good friend, even if he was a little\nstrange. I worried how he\u2019d survive next year without me.\nI\u2019d miss Latin class too\u2014Mr. Brunner\u2019s crazy tournament days and his\nfaith that I could do well.\nAs exam week got closer, Latin was the only test I studied for. I hadn\u2019t\nforgotten what Mr. Brunner had told me about this subject being life-anddeath for me. I wasn\u2019t sure why, but I\u2019d started to believe him.\nThe evening before my final, I got so frustrated I threw the Cambridge\nGuide to Greek Mythology across my dorm room. Words had started\nswimming off the page, circling my head, the letters doing one-eighties as if\nthey were riding skateboards. There was no way I was going to remember\nthe difference between Chiron and Charon, or Polydictes and Polydeuces.\nAnd conjugating those Latin verbs? Forget it.\n\n\f\fI paced the room, feeling like ants were crawling around inside my shirt.\nI remembered Mr. Brunner\u2019s serious expression, his thousand-year-old\neyes. I will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson.\nI took a deep breath. I picked up the mythology book. I\u2019d never asked a\nteacher for help before. Maybe if I talked to Mr. Brunner, he could give me\nsome pointers. At least I could apologize for the big fat F I was about to\nscore on his exam. I didn\u2019t want to leave Yancy Academy with him thinking\nI hadn\u2019t tried.\nI walked downstairs to the faculty offices. Most of them were dark and\nempty, but Mr. Brunner\u2019s door was ajar, light from his window stretching\nacross the hallway floor.\nI was three steps from the door handle when I heard voices inside the\noffice. Mr. Brunner asked a question. A voice that was definitely Grover\u2019s\nsaid \u201c\u2026worried about Percy, sir.\u201d\nI froze.\nI\u2019m not usually an eavesdropper, but I dare you to try not listening if you\nhear your best friend talking about you to an adult.\nI inched closer.\n\u201c\u2026alone this summer,\u201d Grover was saying. \u201cI mean, a Kindly One in the\nschool! Now that we know for sure, and they know too\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe would only make matters worse by rushing him,\u201d Mr. Brunner said.\n\u201cWe need the boy to mature more.\u201d\n\u201cBut he may not have time. The summer solstice deadline\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWill have to be resolved without him, Grover.

A large,\ndark shape paused in front of the glass, then moved on.\nA bead of sweat trickled down my neck.\nSomewhere in the hallway, Mr. Brunner spoke. \u201cNothing,\u201d he murmured.\n\u201cMy nerves haven\u2019t been right since the winter solstice.\u201d\n\u201cMine neither,\u201d Grover said. \u201cBut I could have sworn\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGo back to the dorm,\u201d Mr. Brunner told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a long day of\nexams tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d\nThe lights went out in Mr. Brunner\u2019s office.\nI waited in the dark for what seemed like forever.\n\nFinally, I slipped out into the hallway and made my way back to the\ndorm.\nGrover was lying on his bed, studying his Latin exam notes like he\u2019d\nbeen there all night.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said, bleary-eyed. \u201cYou going to be ready for this test?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\f\u201cYou look awful.\u201d He frowned. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2026tired.\u201d\nI turned so he couldn\u2019t read my expression, and started getting ready for\nbed.\nI didn\u2019t understand what I\u2019d heard downstairs. I wanted to believe I\u2019d\nimagined the whole thing.\nBut one thing was clear: Grover and Mr. Brunner were talking about me\nbehind my back. They thought I was in some kind of danger.\nThe next afternoon, as I was leaving the three-hour Latin exam, my eyes\nswimming with all the Greek and Roman names I\u2019d misspelled, Mr. Brunner\ncalled me back inside.\nFor a moment, I was worried he\u2019d found out about my eavesdropping the\nnight before, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the problem.\n\u201cPercy,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged about leaving Yancy. It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s\nfor the best.\u201d\nHis tone was kind, but the words still embarrassed me. Even though he\nwas speaking quietly, the other kids finishing the test could hear.

Another was cruising\nthe Caribbean for a month. They were juvenile delinquents, like me, but they\nwere rich juvenile delinquents. Their daddies were executives, or\nambassadors, or celebrities. I was a nobody, from a family of nobodies.\nThey asked me what I\u2019d be doing this summer and I told them I was\ngoing back to the city.\nWhat I didn\u2019t tell them was that I\u2019d have to get a summer job walking\ndogs or selling magazine subscriptions, and spend my free time worrying\nabout where I\u2019d go to school in the fall.\n\u201cOh,\u201d one of the guys said. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d\nThey went back to their conversation as if I\u2019d never existed.\nThe only person I dreaded saying good-bye to was Grover, but as it\nturned out, I didn\u2019t have to. He\u2019d booked a ticket to Manhattan on the same\nGreyhound as I had, so there we were, together again, heading into the city.\nDuring the whole bus ride, Grover kept glancing nervously down the\naisle, watching the other passengers. It occurred to me that he\u2019d always acted\nnervous and fidgety when we left Yancy, as if he expected something bad to\nhappen. Before, I\u2019d always assumed he was worried about getting teased.\nBut there was nobody to tease him on the Greyhound.\nFinally, I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\nI said, \u201cLooking for the Kindly Ones?\u201d\nGrover nearly jumped out of his seat. \u201cWha\u2014what do you mean?\u201d\nI confessed about eavesdropping on him and Mr. Brunner the night\nbefore the exam.\nGrover\u2019s eye twitched. \u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026not much. What\u2019s the summer solstice deadline?\u201d\nHe winced. \u201cLook, Percy\u2026I was just worried for you, see? I mean,\nhallucinating about demon math teachers\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGrover\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd I was telling Mr. Brunner that maybe you were overstressed or\nsomething, because there was no such person as Mrs. Dodds, and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGrover, you\u2019re a really, really bad liar.\u201d\nHis ears turned pink.\nFrom his shirt pocket, he fished out a grubby business card. \u201cJust take\nthis, okay? In case you need me this summer.\u201d\n\n\fThe card was in fancy script, which was murder on my dyslexic eyes, but\nI finally made out something like:\n\nGrover Underwood\nKeeper\nHalf-Blood Hill\nLong Island, New York\n(800) 009-0009\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Half\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it aloud!\u201d he yelped. \u201cThat\u2019s my, um\u2026summer address.\u201d\nMy heart sank.

On our side of the highway was nothing but maple\ntrees and litter from passing cars. On the other side, across four lanes of\nasphalt shimmering with afternoon heat, was an old-fashioned fruit stand.\nThe stuff on sale looked really good: heaping boxes of bloodred cherries\nand apples, walnuts and apricots, jugs of cider in a claw-foot tub full of ice.\nThere were no customers, just three old ladies sitting in rocking chairs in the\nshade of a maple tree, knitting the biggest pair of socks I\u2019d ever seen.\nI mean these socks were the size of sweaters, but they were clearly socks.\nThe lady on the right knitted one of them. The lady on the left knitted the\nother. The lady in the middle held an enormous basket of electric-blue yarn.\nAll three women looked ancient, with pale faces wrinkled like fruit\nleather, silver hair tied back in white bandannas, bony arms sticking out of\nbleached cotton dresses.\nThe weirdest thing was, they seemed to be looking right at me.\nI looked over at Grover to say something about this and saw that the\nblood had drained from his face.

I heard Grover catch his breath.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting on the bus,\u201d he told me. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a thousand degrees in there.\u201d\n\u201cCome on!\u201d He pried open the door and climbed inside, but I stayed\nback.\nAcross the road, the old ladies were still watching me. The middle one\ncut the yarn, and I swear I could hear that snip across four lanes of traffic.\nHer two friends balled up the electric-blue socks, leaving me wondering who\nthey could possibly be for\u2014Sasquatch or Godzilla.\nAt the rear of the bus, the driver wrenched a big chunk of smoking metal\nout of the engine compartment. The bus shuddered, and the engine roared\nback to life.\n\n\fThe passengers cheered.\n\u201cDarn right!\u201d yelled the driver. He slapped the bus with his hat.\n\u201cEverybody back on board!\u201d\nOnce we got going, I started feeling feverish, as if I\u2019d caught the flu.\nGrover didn\u2019t look much better.

What is it about them, man?

But Grover was freaking me out, looking at\nme like I was a dead man, muttering \u201cWhy does this always happen?\u201d and\n\u201cWhy does it always have to be sixth grade?\u201d\nWhenever he got upset, Grover\u2019s bladder acted up, so I wasn\u2019t surprised\nwhen, as we got off the bus, he made me promise to wait for him, then made\na beeline for the restroom. Instead of waiting, I got my suitcase, slipped\noutside, and caught the first taxi uptown.\n\u201cEast One-hundred-and-fourth and First,\u201d I told the driver.\nA word about my mother, before you meet her.\nHer name is Sally Jackson and she\u2019s the best person in the world, which\njust proves my theory that the best people have the rottenest luck. Her own\n\n\fparents died in a plane crash when she was five, and she was raised by an\nuncle who didn\u2019t care much about her. She wanted to be a novelist, so she\nspent high school working to save enough money for a college with a good\ncreative-writing program. Then her uncle got cancer, and she quit school her\nsenior year to take care of him. After he died, she was left with no money, no\nfamily, and no diploma.\nThe only good break she ever got was meeting my dad.\nI don\u2019t have any memories of him, just this sort of warm glow, maybe\nthe barest trace of his smile. My mom doesn\u2019t like to talk about him because\nit makes her sad. She has no pictures.\nSee, they weren\u2019t married. She told me he was rich and important, and\ntheir relationship was a secret. Then one day, he set sail across the Atlantic\non some important journey, and he never came back.\nLost at sea, my mom told me. Not dead. Lost at sea.\nShe worked odd jobs, took night classes to get her high school diploma,\nand raised me on her own. She never complained or got mad. Not even once.\nBut I knew I wasn\u2019t an easy kid.\nFinally, she married Gabe Ugliano, who was nice the first thirty seconds\nwe knew him, then showed his true colors as a world-class jerk.

The way\nSmelly Gabe treated her, the way he and I got along\u2026well, when I came\nhome is a good example.\nI walked into our little apartment, hoping my mom would be home from\nwork. Instead, Smelly Gabe was in the living room, playing poker with his\nbuddies. The television blared ESPN.

No Welcome back. Good to see you. How has your life been\nthe last six months?\nGabe had put on weight. He looked like a tuskless walrus in thrift-store\nclothes. He had about three hairs on his head, all combed over his bald scalp,\nas if that made him handsome or something.\n\n\fHe managed the Electronics Mega-Mart in Queens, but he stayed home\nmost of the time. I don\u2019t know why he hadn\u2019t been fired long before. He just\nkept on collecting paychecks, spending the money on cigars that made me\nnauseous, and on beer, of course. Always beer. Whenever I was home, he\nexpected me to provide his gambling funds. He called that our \u201cguy secret.\u201d\nMeaning, if I told my mom, he would punch my lights out.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any cash,\u201d I told him.\nHe raised a greasy eyebrow.\nGabe could sniff out money like a bloodhound, which was surprising,\nsince his own smell should\u2019ve covered up everything else.\n\u201cYou took a taxi from the bus station,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably paid with a\ntwenty.

She\u2019d brought me a huge bag of \u201cfree\nsamples,\u201d the way she always did when I came home.\nWe sat together on the edge of the bed. While I attacked the blueberry\nsour strings, she ran her hand through my hair and demanded to know\neverything I hadn\u2019t put in my letters. She didn\u2019t mention anything about my\ngetting expelled. She didn\u2019t seem to care about that. But was I okay? Was\nher little boy doing all right?\n\nI told her she was smothering me, and to lay off and all that, but secretly,\nI was really, really glad to see her.\nFrom the other room, Gabe yelled, \u201cHey, Sally\u2014how about some bean\ndip, huh?\u201d\n\n\fI gritted my teeth.\nMy mom is the nicest lady in the world. She should\u2019ve been married to a\nmillionaire, not to some jerk like Gabe.\nFor her sake, I tried to sound upbeat about my last days at Yancy\nAcademy. I told her I wasn\u2019t too down about the expulsion. I\u2019d lasted almost\nthe whole year this time. I\u2019d made some new friends. I\u2019d done pretty well in\nLatin. And honestly, the fights hadn\u2019t been as bad as the headmaster said. I\nliked Yancy Academy. I really did. I put such a good spin on the year, I\nalmost convinced myself. I started choking up, thinking about Grover and\nMr. Brunner. Even Nancy Bobofit suddenly didn\u2019t seem so bad.\nUntil that trip to the museum\u2026\n\u201cWhat?\u201d my mom asked. Her eyes tugged at my conscience, trying to\npull out the secrets. \u201cDid something scare you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mom.\u201d\nI felt bad lying. I wanted to tell her about Mrs. Dodds and the three old\nladies with the yarn, but I thought it would sound stupid.\nShe pursed her lips. She knew I was holding back, but she didn\u2019t push\nme.\n\u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the beach.\u201d\nMy eyes widened. \u201cMontauk?\u201d\n\u201cThree nights\u2014same cabin.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cAs soon as I get changed.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t believe it.

It\nwas a little pastel box with faded curtains, half sunken into the dunes. There\nwas always sand in the sheets and spiders in the cabinets, and most of the\ntime the sea was too cold to swim in.\nI loved the place.\nWe\u2019d been going there since I was a baby. My mom had been going even\nlonger. She never exactly said, but I knew why the beach was special to her.\nIt was the place where she\u2019d met my dad.\nAs we got closer to Montauk, she seemed to grow younger, years of\nworry and work disappearing from her face. Her eyes turned the color of the\nsea.\nWe got there at sunset, opened all the cabin\u2019s windows, and went through\nour usual cleaning routine. We walked on the beach, fed blue corn chips to\nthe seagulls, and munched on blue jelly beans, blue saltwater taffy, and all\nthe other free samples my mom had brought from work.\nI guess I should explain the blue food.\nSee, Gabe had once told my mom there was no such thing. They had this\nfight, which seemed like a really small thing at the time. But ever since, my\nmom went out of her way to eat blue. She baked blue birthday cakes. She\nmixed blueberry smoothies. She bought blue-corn tortilla chips and brought\nhome blue candy from the shop. This\u2014along with keeping her maiden\nname, Jackson, rather than calling herself Mrs. Ugliano\u2014was proof that she\nwasn\u2019t totally suckered by Gabe. She did have a rebellious streak, like me.\nWhen it got dark, we made a fire. We roasted hot dogs and\nmarshmallows. Mom told me stories about when she was a kid, back before\n\n\fher parents died in the plane crash. She told me about the books she wanted\nto write someday, when she had enough money to quit the candy shop.\nEventually, I got up the nerve to ask about what was always on my mind\nwhenever we came to Montauk\u2014my father. Mom\u2019s eyes went all misty. I\nfigured she would tell me the same things she always did, but I never got\ntired of hearing them.\n\u201cHe was kind, Percy,\u201d she said. \u201cTall, handsome, and powerful. But\ngentle, too. You have his black hair, you know, and his green eyes.\u201d\nMom fished a blue jelly bean out of her candy bag. \u201cI wish he could see\nyou, Percy. He would be so proud.\u201d\nI wondered how she could say that. What was so great about me? A\ndyslexic, hyperactive boy with a D+ report card, kicked out of school for the\nsixth time in six years.\n\u201cHow old was I?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean\u2026when he left?\u201d\nShe watched the flames. \u201cHe was only with me for one summer, Percy.\nRight here at this beach.

When the teachers threatened to call the police, he went away\ngrowling, but no one believed me when I told them that under his broadbrimmed hat, the man only had one eye, right in the middle of his head.\nBefore that\u2014a really early memory. I was in preschool, and a teacher\naccidentally put me down for a nap in a cot that a snake had slithered into.\nMy mom screamed when she came to pick me up and found me playing with\na limp, scaly rope I\u2019d somehow managed to strangle to death with my meaty\ntoddler hands.\nIn every single school, something creepy had happened, something\nunsafe, and I was forced to move.\nI knew I should tell my mom about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and\nMrs. Dodds at the art museum, about my weird hallucination that I had\nsliced my math teacher into dust with a sword. But I couldn\u2019t make myself\ntell her. I had a strange feeling the news would end our trip to Montauk, and\nI didn\u2019t want that.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to keep you as close to me as I could,\u201d my mom said. \u201cThey\ntold me that was a mistake. But there\u2019s only one other option, Percy\u2014the\nplace your father wanted to send you. And I just\u2026I just can\u2019t stand to do it.\u201d\n\u201cMy father wanted me to go to a special school?\u201d\n\u201cNot a school,\u201d she said softly. \u201cA summer camp.\u201d\nMy head was spinning. Why would my dad\u2014who hadn\u2019t even stayed\nlong enough to see me born\u2014talk to my mom about a summer camp? And if\nit was so important, why hadn\u2019t she ever mentioned it before?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Percy,\u201d she said, seeing the look in my eyes. \u201cBut I can\u2019t talk\nabout it. I\u2014I couldn\u2019t send you to that place. It might mean saying good-bye\nto you for good.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cFor good?

I thought about Mrs. Dodds and\nthe moment when she\u2019d changed into the thing with pointed teeth and\nleathery wings. My limbs went numb from delayed shock. She really hadn\u2019t\nbeen human. She\u2019d meant to kill me.\nThen I thought about Mr. Brunner\u2026and the sword he had thrown me.\nBefore I could ask Grover about that, the hair rose on the back of my neck.\nThere was a blinding flash, a jaw-rattling boom!, and our car exploded.\nI remember feeling weightless, like I was being crushed, fried, and hosed\ndown all the at the same time.\nI peeled my forehead off the back of the driver\u2019s seat and said, \u201cOw.\u201d\n\u201cPercy!\u201d my mom shouted.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay\u2026.\u201d\n\n\fI tried to shake off the daze. I wasn\u2019t dead. The car hadn\u2019t really\nexploded. We\u2019d swerved into a ditch. Our driver\u2019s-side doors were wedged\nin the mud. The roof had cracked open like an eggshell and rain was pouring\nin.\n\n\fLightning. That was the only explanation. We\u2019d been blasted right off the\nroad. Next to me in the backseat was a big motionless lump. \u201cGrover!\u201d\n\n\fHe was slumped over, blood trickling from the side of his mouth. I shook\nhis furry hip, thinking, No! Even if you are half barnyard animal, you\u2019re my\nbest friend and I don\u2019t want you to die!\nThen he groaned \u201cFood,\u201d and I knew there was hope.\n\u201cPercy,\u201d my mother said, \u201cwe have to\u2026\u201d Her voice faltered.\nI looked back. In a flash of lightning, through the mud-spattered rear\nwindshield, I saw a figure lumbering toward us on the shoulder of the road.\nThe sight of it made my skin crawl. It was a dark silhouette of a huge guy,\nlike a football player. He seemed to be holding a blanket over his head. His\ntop half was bulky and fuzzy. His upraised hands made it look like he had\nhorns.\nI swallowed hard. \u201cWho is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPercy,\u201d my mother said, deadly serious. \u201cGet out of the car.\u201d\nMy mother threw herself against the driver\u2019s-side door.

Don\u2019t stop until you reach the door.\u201d\n\u201cMom, you\u2019re coming too.\u201d\nHer face was pale, her eyes as sad as when she looked at the ocean.\n\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted. \u201cYou are coming with me. Help me carry Grover.\u201d\n\u201cFood!\u201d Grover moaned, a little louder.\nThe man with the blanket on his head kept coming toward us, making his\ngrunting, snorting noises. As he got closer, I realized he couldn\u2019t be holding\na blanket over his head, because his hands\u2014huge meaty hands\u2014were\nswinging at his sides. There was no blanket. Meaning the bulky, fuzzy mass\nthat was too big to be his head\u2026was his head. And the points that looked\nlike horns\u2026\n\n\f\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want us,\u201d my mother told me. \u201cHe wants you.

He was surprisingly light, but I couldn\u2019t have carried him very far if\nmy mom hadn\u2019t come to my aid.\nTogether, we draped Grover\u2019s arms over our shoulders and started\nstumbling uphill through wet waist-high grass.\nGlancing back, I got my first clear look at the monster. He was seven feet\ntall, easy, his arms and legs like something from the cover of Muscle Man\nmagazine\u2014bulging biceps and triceps and a bunch of other \u2019ceps, all stuffed\nlike baseballs under vein-webbed skin. He wore no clothes except underwear\n\u2014I mean, bright white Fruit of the Looms\u2014which would\u2019ve looked funny,\nexcept that the top half of his body was so scary. Coarse brown hair started\nat about his belly button and got thicker as it reached his shoulders.\nHis neck was a mass of muscle and fur leading up to his enormous head,\nwhich had a snout as long as my arm, snotty nostrils with a gleaming brass\nring, cruel black eyes, and horns\u2014enormous black-and-white horns with\npoints you just couldn\u2019t get from an electric sharpener.\nI recognized the monster, all right.

He raised the car\nover his head and threw it down the road. It slammed into the wet asphalt\nand skidded in a shower of sparks for about half a mile before coming to a\nstop. The gas tank exploded.\nNot a scratch, I remembered Gabe saying.\nOops.\n\u201cPercy,\u201d my mom said. \u201cWhen he sees us, he\u2019ll charge.

Another few seconds and he\u2019d be on top of us.\nMy mother must\u2019ve been exhausted, but she shouldered Grover. \u201cGo,\nPercy! Separate! Remember what I said.\u201d\n\n\f\fI didn\u2019t want to split up, but I had the feeling she was right\u2014it was our\nonly chance. I sprinted to the left, turned, and saw the creature bearing down\non me. His black eyes glowed with hate. He reeked like rotten meat.\nHe lowered his head and charged, those razor-sharp horns aimed straight\nat my chest.\nThe fear in my stomach made me want to bolt, but that wouldn\u2019t work. I\ncould never outrun this thing. So I held my ground, and at the last moment, I\njumped to the side.\nThe bull-man stormed past like a freight train, then bellowed with\nfrustration and turned, but not toward me this time, toward my mother, who\nwas setting Grover down in the grass.\nWe\u2019d reached the crest of the hill. Down the other side I could see a\nvalley, just as my mother had said, and the lights of a farmhouse glowing\nyellow through the rain. But that was half a mile away. We\u2019d never make it.\nThe bull-man grunted, pawing the ground. He kept eyeing my mother,\nwho was now retreating slowly downhill, back toward the road, trying to\nlead the monster away from Grover.\n\u201cRun, Percy!\u201d she told me. \u201cI can\u2019t go any farther. Run!\u201d\nBut I just stood there, frozen in fear, as the monster charged her. She\ntried to sidestep, as she\u2019d told me to do, but the monster had learned his\nlesson.

The smell of rotten meat burned\nmy nostrils.\nThe monster shook himself around and bucked like a rodeo bull. He\nshould have just backed up into the tree and smashed me flat, but I was\nstarting to realize that this thing had only one gear: forward.\nMeanwhile, Grover started groaning in the grass. I wanted to yell at him\nto shut up, but the way I was getting tossed around, if I opened my mouth I\u2019d\nbite my own tongue off.\n\u201cFood!\u201d Grover moaned.\nThe bull-man wheeled toward him, pawed the ground again, and got\nready to charge.

The storm still rumbled, but only in the distance. I\nsmelled like livestock and my knees were shaking. My head felt like it was\nsplitting open. I was weak and scared and trembling with grief.

He flailed, clawing at his chest, then\nbegan to disintegrate\u2014not like my mother, in a flash of golden light, but like\ncrumbling sand, blown away in chunks by the wind, the same way Mrs.\nDodds had burst apart.\nThe monster was gone.\n\n\fThe rain had stopped. The storm still rumbled, but only in the distance. I\nsmelled like livestock and my knees were shaking. My head felt like it was\nsplitting open. I was weak and scared and trembling with grief. I\u2019d just seen\nmy mother vanish. I wanted to lie down and cry, but there was Grover,\nneeding my help, so I managed to haul him up and stagger down into the\nvalley, toward the lights of the farmhouse. I was crying, calling for my\nmother, but I held on to Grover\u2014I wasn\u2019t going to let him go.\nThe last thing I remember is collapsing on a wooden porch, looking up at\na ceiling fan circling above me, moths flying around a yellow light, and the\nstern faces of a familiar-looking bearded man and a pretty girl, her blond\nhair curled like a princess\u2019s. They both looked down at me, and the girl said,\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one. He must be.\u201d\n\u201cSilence, Annabeth,\u201d the man said. \u201cHe\u2019s still conscious.

I was sitting in\na deck chair on a huge porch, gazing across a meadow at green hills in the\ndistance. The breeze smelled like strawberries. There was a blanket over my\nlegs, a pillow behind my neck. All that was great, but my mouth felt like a\nscorpion had been using it for a nest. My tongue was dry and nasty and\nevery one of my teeth hurt.\nOn the table next to me was a tall drink. It looked like iced apple juice,\nwith a green straw and a paper parasol stuck through a maraschino cherry.\nMy hand was so weak I almost dropped the glass once I got my fingers\naround it.\n\u201cCareful,\u201d a familiar voice said.\nGrover was leaning against the porch railing, looking like he hadn\u2019t slept\nin a week.

Between here and there, I simply couldn\u2019t\nprocess everything I was seeing. The landscape was dotted with buildings\nthat looked like ancient Greek architecture\u2014an open-air pavilion, an\namphitheater, a circular arena\u2014except that they all looked brand new, their\nwhite marble columns sparkling in the sun. In a nearby sandpit, a dozen high\nschool\u2013age kids and satyrs played volleyball. Canoes glided across a small\nlake. Kids in bright orange T-shirts like Grover\u2019s were chasing each other\naround a cluster of cabins nestled in the woods. Some shot targets at an\narchery range. Others rode horses down a wooded trail, and, unless I was\nhallucinating, some of their horses had wings.\nDown at the end of the porch, two men sat across from each other at a\ncard table. The blond-haired girl who\u2019d spoon-fed me popcorn-flavored\npudding was leaning on the porch rail next to them.\n\n\fThe man facing me was small, but porky. He had a red nose, big watery\neyes, and curly hair so black it was almost purple. He looked like those\npaintings of baby angels\u2014what do you call them, hubbubs? No, cherubs.\nThat\u2019s it. He looked like a cherub who\u2019d turned middle-aged in a trailer park.\n\n\fHe wore a tiger-pattern Hawaiian shirt, and he would\u2019ve fit right in at one of\nGabe\u2019s power parties, except I got the feeling this guy could\u2019ve out-gambled\neven my stepfather.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Mr. D,\u201d Grover murmured to me. \u201cHe\u2019s the camp director.

His eyes had that\nmischievous glint they sometimes got in class when he pulled a pop quiz and\nmade all the multiple choice answers B.\n\u201cAh, good, Percy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have four for pinochle.\u201d\nHe offered me a chair to the right of Mr. D, who looked at me with\nbloodshot eyes and heaved a great sigh. \u201cOh, I suppose I must say it.\nWelcome to Camp Half-Blood. There. Now, don\u2019t expect me to be glad to\nsee you.\u201d\n\u201cUh, thanks.\u201d I scooted a little farther away from him because, if there\nwas one thing I had learned from living with Gabe, it was how to tell when\nan adult has been hitting the happy juice. If Mr. D was a stranger to alcohol,\nI was a satyr.\n\u201cAnnabeth?\u201d Mr. Brunner called to the blond girl.\nShe came forward and Mr. Brunner introduced us. \u201cThis young lady\nnursed you back to health, Percy. Annabeth, my dear, why don\u2019t you go\ncheck on Percy\u2019s bunk? We\u2019ll be putting him in cabin eleven for now.\u201d\nAnnabeth said, \u201cSure, Chiron.\u201d\nShe was probably my age, maybe a couple inches taller, and a whole lot\nmore athletic looking. With her deep tan and her curly blond hair, she was\nalmost exactly what I thought a stereotypical California girl would look like,\nexcept her eyes ruined the image. They were startling gray, like storm\nclouds: pretty, but intimidating, too, as if she were analyzing the best way to\ntake me down in a fight.\nShe glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands, then back at me. I\nimagined she was going to say, You killed a minotaur! or Wow, you\u2019re so\nawesome! or something like that.\nInstead she said, \u201cYou drool when you sleep.\u201d\nThen she sprinted off down the lawn, her blond hair flying behind her.\n\u201cSo,\u201d I said, anxious to change the subject. \u201cYou, uh, work here, Mr.\nBrunner?\u201d\n\u201cNot Mr. Brunner,\u201d the ex\u2013Mr. Brunner said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that was a\npseudonym. You may call me Chiron.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOkay.\u201d Totally confused, I looked at the director. \u201cAnd Mr. D\u2026does\nthat stand for something?\u201d\nMr. D stopped shuffling the cards. He looked at me like I\u2019d just belched\nloudly. \u201cYoung man, names are powerful things. You don\u2019t just go around\nusing them for no reason.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Right. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI must say, Percy,\u201d Chiron-Brunner broke in, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you alive.\nIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve made a house call to a potential camper. I\u2019d\nhate to think I\u2019ve wasted my time.\u201d\n\u201cHouse call?\u201d\n\u201cMy year at Yancy Academy, to instruct you. We have satyrs at most\nschools, of course, keeping a lookout. But Grover alerted me as soon as he\nmet you. He sensed you were something special, so I decided to come\nupstate. I convinced the other Latin teacher to\u2026ah, take a leave of absence.\u201d\nI tried to remember the beginning of the school year. It seemed like so\nlong ago, but I did have a fuzzy memory of there being another Latin teacher\nmy first week at Yancy. Then, without explanation, he had disappeared and\nMr. Brunner had taken the class.\n\u201cYou came to Yancy just to teach me?\u201d I asked.\nChiron nodded. \u201cHonestly, I wasn\u2019t sure about you at first. We contacted\nyour mother, let her know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were\nready for Camp Half-Blood.

What if I told you, Perseus\nJackson, that someday people would call you a myth, just created to explain\nhow little boys can get over losing their mothers?\u201d\nMy heart pounded.

You.\u201d\n\n\fHe turned to look at me straight on, and I saw a kind of purplish fire in\nhis eyes, a hint that this whiny, plump little man was only showing me the\ntiniest bit of his true nature. I saw visions of grape vines choking unbelievers\nto death, drunken warriors insane with battle lust, sailors screaming as their\nhands turned to flippers, their faces elongating into dolphin snouts. I knew\nthat if I pushed him, Mr. D would show me worse things. He would plant a\ndisease in my brain that would leave me wearing a straitjacket in a rubber\nroom for the rest of my life.\n\u201cWould you like to test me, child?\u201d he said quietly.\n\u201cNo. No, sir.\u201d\nThe fire died a little. He turned back to his card game. \u201cI believe I win.\u201d\n\u201cNot quite, Mr. D,\u201d Chiron said. He set down a straight, tallied the\npoints, and said, \u201cThe game goes to me.\u201d\nI thought Mr. D was going to vaporize Chiron right out of his wheelchair,\nbut he just sighed through his nose, as if he were used to being beaten by the\nLatin teacher. He got up, and Grover rose, too.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Mr. D said. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll take a nap before the sing-along\ntonight. But first, Grover, we need to talk, again, about your less-thanperfect performance on this assignment.\u201d\nGrover\u2019s face beaded with sweat. \u201cY-yes, sir.\u201d\nMr. D turned to me. \u201cCabin eleven, Percy Jackson. And mind your\nmanners.\u201d\nHe swept into the farmhouse, Grover following miserably.\n\u201cWill Grover be okay?\u201d I asked Chiron.\nChiron nodded, though he looked a bit troubled. \u201cOld Dionysus isn\u2019t\nreally mad.

He\u2019s been\u2026ah, grounded, I guess you\nwould say, and he can\u2019t stand waiting another century before he\u2019s allowed to\ngo back to Olympus.\u201d\n\u201cMount Olympus,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me there really is a palace\nthere?\u201d\n\u201cWell now, there\u2019s Mount Olympus in Greece. And then there\u2019s the home\nof the gods, the convergence point of their powers, which did indeed use to\nbe on Mount Olympus. It\u2019s still called Mount Olympus, out of respect to the\nold ways, but the palace moves, Percy, just as the gods do.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the Greek gods are here? Like\u2026in America?\u201d\n\u201cWell, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.\u201d\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cCome now, Percy. What you call \u2018Western civilization.\u2019 Do you think\nit\u2019s just an abstract concept? No, it\u2019s a living force. A collective\nconsciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are\npart of it. You might even say they are the source of it, or at least, they are\ntied so tightly to it that they couldn\u2019t possible fade, not unless all of Western\ncivilization were obliterated. The fire started in Greece. Then, as you well\nknow\u2014or as I hope you know, since you passed my course\u2014the heart of the\nfire moved to Rome, and so did the gods. Oh, different names, perhaps\u2014\nJupiter for Zeus, Venus for Aphrodite, and so on\u2014but the same forces, the\nsame gods.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then they died.\u201d\n\u201cDied? No. Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to\nFrance, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods\nwere there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is\nlook at the architecture. People do not forget the gods. Every place they\u2019ve\nruled, for the last three thousand years, you can see them in paintings, in\nstatues, on the most important buildings. And yes, Percy, of course they are\nnow in your United States. Look at your symbol, the eagle of Zeus. Look at\nthe statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center, the Greek facades of your\ngovernment buildings in Washington. I defy you to find any American city\nwhere the Olympians are not prominently displayed in multiple places. Like\nit or not\u2014and believe me, plenty of people weren\u2019t very fond of Rome,\neither\u2014America is now the heart of the flame. It is the great power of the\nWest. And so Olympus is here. And we are here.\u201d\nIt was all too much, especially the fact that I seemed to be included in\nChiron\u2019s we, as if I were part of some club.\n\u201cWho are you, Chiron? Who\u2026who am I?\u201d\nChiron smiled. He shifted his weight as if he were going to get up out of\nhis wheelchair, but I knew that was impossible. He was paralyzed from the\nwaist down.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he mused. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the question we all want\nanswered, isn\u2019t it?

But there was something odd\nabout the way he did it. His blanket fell away from his legs, but the legs\n\n\fdidn\u2019t move. His waist kept getting longer, rising above his belt. At first, I\nthought he was wearing very long, white velvet underwear, but as he kept\nrising out of the chair, taller than any man, I realized that the velvet\nunderwear wasn\u2019t underwear; it was the front of an animal, muscle and\nsinew under coarse white fur. And the wheelchair wasn\u2019t a chair. It was some\nkind of container, an enormous box on wheels, and it must\u2019ve been magic,\nbecause there\u2019s no way it could\u2019ve held all of him. A leg came out, long and\nknobby-kneed, with a huge polished hoof. Then another front leg, then\nhindquarters, and then the box was empty, nothing but a metal shell with a\ncouple of fake human legs attached.\nI stared at the horse who had just sprung from the wheelchair: a huge\nwhite stallion. But where its neck should be was the upper body of my Latin\nteacher, smoothly grafted to the horse\u2019s trunk.\n\u201cWhat a relief,\u201d the centaur said. \u201cI\u2019d been cooped up in there so long,\nmy fetlocks had fallen asleep. Now, come, Percy Jackson. Let\u2019s meet the\nother campers.\u201d\n\n\f\fO\n\nNCE I GOT OVER THE FACT THAT my Latin teacher was a horse, we had a\n\nnice tour, though I was careful not to walk behind him. I\u2019d done pooperscooper patrol in the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade a few times, and, I\u2019m\nsorry, I did not trust Chiron\u2019s back end the way I trusted his front.\nWe passed the volleyball pit. Several of the campers nudged each other.\nOne pointed to the minotaur horn I was carrying. Another said, \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d\nMost of the campers were older than me. Their satyr friends were bigger\nthan Grover, all of them trotting around in orange CAMP HALF-BLOOD T-shirts,\nwith nothing else to cover their bare shaggy hindquarters. I wasn\u2019t normally\nshy, but the way they stared at me made me uncomfortable. I felt like they\nwere expecting me to do a flip or something.\nI looked back at the farmhouse. It was a lot bigger than I\u2019d realized\u2014\nfour stories tall, sky blue with white trim, like an upscale seaside resort. I\nwas checking out the brass eagle weather vane on top when something\ncaught my eye, a shadow in the uppermost window of the attic gable.\n\n\fSomething had moved the curtain, just for a second, and I got the distinct\nimpression I was being watched.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up there?\u201d I asked Chiron.\nHe looked where I was pointing, and his smile faded. \u201cJust the attic.\u201d\n\u201cSomebody lives there?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said with finality. \u201cNot a single living thing.\u201d\nI got the feeling he was being truthful. But I was also sure something had\nmoved that curtain.\n\u201cCome along, Percy,\u201d Chiron said, his lighthearted tone now a little\nforced. \u201cLots to see.\u201d\nWe walked through the strawberry fields, where campers were picking\nbushels of berries while a satyr played a tune on a reed pipe.\nChiron told me the camp grew a nice crop for export to New York\nrestaurants and Mount Olympus. \u201cIt pays our expenses,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd\nthe strawberries take almost no effort.\u201d\nHe said Mr. D had this effect on fruit-bearing plants: they just went crazy\nwhen he was around.

His music was causing lines of bugs\nto leave the strawberry patch in every direction, like refugees fleeing a fire. I\nwondered if Grover could work that kind of magic with music. I wondered if\nhe was still inside the farmhouse, getting chewed out by Mr. D.\n\u201cGrover won\u2019t get in too much trouble, will he?\u201d I asked Chiron. \u201cI\nmean\u2026he was a good protector. Really.\u201d\nChiron sighed. He shed his tweed jacket and draped it over his horse\u2019s\nback like a saddle. \u201cGrover has big dreams, Percy. Perhaps bigger than are\nreasonable. To reach his goal, he must first demonstrate great courage by\nsucceeding as a keeper, finding a new camper and bringing him safely to\nHalf-Blood Hill.\u201d\n\u201cBut he did that!\u201d\n\u201cI might agree with you,\u201d Chiron said. \u201cBut it is not my place to judge.\nDionysus and the Council of Cloven Elders must decide. I\u2019m afraid they\nmight not see this assignment as a success. After all, Grover lost you in New\nYork. Then there\u2019s the unfortunate\u2026ah\u2026fate of your mother. And the fact\nthat Grover was unconscious when you dragged him over the property line.\n\n\fThe council might question whether this shows any courage on Grover\u2019s\npart.\u201d\nI wanted to protest. None of what happened was Grover\u2019s fault. I also\nfelt really, really guilty. If I hadn\u2019t given Grover the slip at the bus station, he\nmight not have gotten in trouble.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll get a second chance, won\u2019t he?\u201d\nChiron winced. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that was Grover\u2019s second chance, Percy. The\ncouncil was not anxious to give him another, either, after what happened the\nfirst time, five years ago. Olympus knows, I advised him to wait longer\nbefore trying again. He\u2019s still so small for his age\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHow old is he?\u201d\n\u201cOh, twenty-eight.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! And he\u2019s in sixth grade?\u201d\n\u201cSatyrs mature half as fast as humans, Percy. Grover has been the\nequivalent of a middle school student for the past six years.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\u201cQuite,\u201d Chiron agreed. \u201cAt any rate, Grover is a late bloomer, even by\nsatyr standards, and not yet very accomplished at woodland magic. Alas, he\nwas anxious to pursue his dream. Perhaps now he will find some other\ncareer\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened the first time? Was it really so\nbad?\u201d\nChiron looked away quickly. \u201cLet\u2019s move along, shall we?\u201d\n\n\f\fBut I wasn\u2019t quite ready to let the subject drop. Something had occurred\nto me when Chiron talked about my mother\u2019s fate, as if he were intentionally\navoiding the word death. The beginnings of an idea\u2014a tiny, hopeful fire\u2014\nstarted forming in my mind.\n\u201cChiron,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the gods and Olympus and all that are real\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, child?\u201d\n\u201cDoes that mean the Underworld is real, too?\u201d\nChiron\u2019s expression darkened.\n\u201cYes, child.\u201d He paused, as if choosing his words carefully. \u201cThere is a\nplace where spirits go after death.

I think a size five will do.\nI\u2019ll visit the armory later.\u201d\nI wanted to ask what kind of summer camp had an armory, but there was\ntoo much else to think about, so the tour continued. We saw the archery\nrange, the canoeing lake, the stables (which Chiron didn\u2019t seem to like very\nmuch), the javelin range, the sing-along amphitheater, and the arena where\nChiron said they held sword and spear fights.\n\u201cSword and spear fights?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cCabin challenges and all that,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot lethal. Usually. Oh,\nyes, and there\u2019s the mess hall.\u201d\nChiron pointed to an outdoor pavilion framed in white Grecian columns\non a hill overlooking the sea. There were a dozen stone picnic tables. No\nroof. No walls.\n\u201cWhat do you do when it rains?\u201d I asked,\n\n\fChiron looked at me as if I\u2019d gone a little weird. \u201cWe still have to eat,\ndon\u2019t we?\u201d I decided to drop the subject.\nFinally, he showed me the cabins. There were twelve of them, nestled in\nthe woods by the lake. They were arranged in a U, with two at the base and\nfive in a row on either side. And they were without doubt the most bizarre\ncollection of buildings I\u2019d ever seen.\nExcept for the fact that each had a large brass number above the door\n(odds on the left side, evens on the right), they looked absolutely nothing\nalike. Number nine had smokestacks, like a tiny factory. Number four had\ntomato vines on the walls and a roof made out of real grass. Seven seemed to\nbe made of solid gold, which gleamed so much in the sunlight it was almost\nimpossible to look at. They all faced a commons area about the size of a\nsoccer field, dotted with Greek statues, fountains, flower beds, and a couple\nof basketball hoops (which were more my speed).\nIn the center of the field was a huge stone-lined firepit. Even though it\nwas a warm afternoon, the hearth smoldered. A girl about nine years old was\ntending the flames, poking the coals with a stick.\nThe pair of cabins at the head of the field, numbers one and two, looked\nlike his-and-hers mausoleums, big white marble boxes with heavy columns\nin front. Cabin one was the biggest and bulkiest of the twelve. Its polished\nbronze doors shimmered like a hologram, so that from different angles\nlightning bolts seemed to streak across them. Cabin two was more graceful\nsomehow, with slimmer columns garlanded with pomegranates and flowers.\nThe walls were carved with images of peacocks.\n\n\f\f\f\u201cZeus and Hera?\u201d I guessed.\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Chiron said.\n\u201cTheir cabins look empty.\u201d\n\u201cSeveral of the cabins are. That\u2019s true. No one ever stays in one or two.\u201d\nOkay. So each cabin had a different god, like a mascot. Twelve cabins for\nthe twelve Olympians.

The\nouter walls were rough gray stone studded with pieces of seashell and coral,\nas if the slabs had been hewn straight from the bottom of the ocean floor. I\npeeked inside the open doorway and Chiron said, \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d\nBefore he could pull me back, I caught the salty scent of the interior, like\nthe wind on the shore at Montauk. The interior walls glowed like abalone.\nThere were six empty bunk beds with silk sheets turned down. But there was\nno sign anyone had ever slept there. The place felt so sad and lonely, I was\nglad when Chiron put his hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cCome along,\nPercy.\u201d\nMost of the other cabins were crowded with campers.\nNumber five was bright red\u2014a real nasty paint job, as if the color had\nbeen splashed on with buckets and fists. The roof was lined with barbed\nwire. A stuffed wild boar\u2019s head hung over the doorway, and its eyes seemed\nto follow me. Inside I could see a bunch of mean-looking kids, both girls and\nboys, arm wrestling and arguing with each other while rock music blared.\nThe loudest was a girl maybe thirteen or fourteen. She wore a size XXXL\nCAMP HALF-BLOOD T-shirt under a camouflage jacket. She zeroed in on me\nand gave me an evil sneer. She reminded me of Nancy Bobofit, though the\ncamper girl was much bigger and tougher looking, and her hair was long and\nstringy, and brown instead of red.\nI kept walking, trying to stay clear of Chiron\u2019s hooves. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen\nany other centaurs,\u201d I observed.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Chiron sadly. \u201cMy kinsmen are a wild and barbaric folk, I\u2019m\nafraid. You might encounter them in the wilderness, or at major sporting\nevents. But you won\u2019t see any here.\u201d\n\u201cYou said your name was Chiron. Are you really\u2026\u201d\nHe smiled down at me. \u201cThe Chiron from the stories? Trainer of\nHercules and all that? Yes, Percy, I am.\u201d\n\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t you be dead?\u201d\n\n\fChiron paused, as if the question intrigued him. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know\nabout should be. The truth is, I can\u2019t be dead. You see, eons ago the gods\ngranted my wish. I could continue the work I loved. I could be a teacher of\nheroes as long as humanity needed me. I gained much from that wish\u2026and I\ngave up much. But I\u2019m still here, so I can only assume I\u2019m still needed.\u201d\nI thought about being a teacher for three thousand years.

The threshold was worn down, the brown\npaint peeling. Over the doorway was one of those doctor\u2019s symbols, a\nwinged pole with two snakes wrapped around it. What did they call it\u2026? A\ncaduceus.\nInside, it was packed with people, both boys and girls, way more than the\nnumber of bunk beds. Sleeping bags were spread all over on the floor. It\nlooked like a gym where the Red Cross had set up an evacuation center.\n\n\fChiron didn\u2019t go in. The door was too low for him. But when the\ncampers saw him they all stood and bowed respectfully.\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d Chiron said. \u201cGood luck, Percy. I\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d\nHe galloped away toward the archery range.\nI stood in the doorway, looking at the kids. They weren\u2019t bowing\nanymore. They were staring at me, sizing me up. I knew this routine. I\u2019d\ngone though it at enough schools.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Annabeth prompted. \u201cGo on.\u201d\nSo naturally I tripped coming in the door and made a total fool of myself.\nThere were some snickers from the campers, but none of them said anything.\nAnnabeth announced, \u201cPercy Jackson, meet cabin eleven.\u201d\n\u201cRegular or undetermined?\u201d somebody asked.\nI didn\u2019t know what to say, but Annabeth said, \u201cUndetermined.\u201d\nEverybody groaned.\nA guy who was a little older than the rest came forward. \u201cNow, now,\ncampers. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. Welcome, Percy. You can have that spot\non the floor, right over there.\u201d\nThe guy was about nineteen, and he looked pretty cool. He was tall and\nmuscular, with short-cropped sandy hair and a friendly smile. He wore an\norange tank top, cutoffs, sandals, and a leather necklace with five differentcolored clay beads. The only thing unsettling about his appearance was a\nthick white scar that ran from just beneath his right eye to his jaw, like an old\nknife slash.\n\n\f\f\u201cThis is Luke,\u201d Annabeth said, and her voice sounded different\nsomehow. I glanced over and could\u2019ve sworn she was blushing. She saw me\nlooking, and her expression hardened again. \u201cHe\u2019s your counselor for now.\u201d\n\u201cFor now?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re undetermined,\u201d Luke explained patiently. \u201cThey don\u2019t know\nwhat cabin to put you in, so you\u2019re here.

I had nothing to put\nthere to mark it as my own, no luggage, no clothes, no sleeping bag. Just the\nMinotaur\u2019s horn.

Why is everybody so crowded together? There are\nplenty of empty bunks right over there.\u201d\nI pointed to the first few cabins, and Annabeth turned pale. \u201cYou don\u2019t\njust choose a cabin, Percy.

Perhaps she\nwasn\u2019t sure she could follow through on the threat. She turned toward me.\n\u201cWho\u2019s this little runt?\u201d\n\u201cPercy Jackson,\u201d Annabeth said, \u201cmeet Clarisse, Daughter of Ares.\u201d\nI blinked. \u201cLike\u2026the war god?\u201d\nClarisse sneered. \u201cYou got a problem with that?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, recovering my wits. \u201cIt explains the bad smell.\u201d\nClarisse growled. \u201cWe got an initiation ceremony for newbies, Prissy.\u201d\n\u201cPercy.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.

There was a line of toilets on one side and a line of shower stalls\ndown the other. It smelled just like any public bathroom, and I was thinking\n\u2014as much as I could think with Clarisse ripping my hair out\u2014that if this\nplace belonged to the gods, they should\u2019ve been able to afford classier johns.\nClarisse\u2019s friends were all laughing, and I was trying to find the strength\nI\u2019d used to fight the Minotaur, but it just wasn\u2019t there.\n\u201cLike he\u2019s \u2018Big Three\u2019 material,\u201d Clarisse said as she pushed me toward\none of the toilets. \u201cYeah, right. Minotaur probably fell over laughing, he was\nso stupid looking.\u201d\nHer friends snickered.\nAnnabeth stood in the corner, watching through her fingers.\nClarisse bent me over on my knees and started pushing my head toward\nthe toilet bowl. It reeked like rusted pipes and, well, like what goes into\n\n\ftoilets. I strained to keep my head up. I was looking at the scummy water,\nthinking, I will not go into that. I won\u2019t.\nThen something happened. I felt a tug in the pit of my stomach. I heard\nthe plumbing rumble, the pipes shudder. Clarisse\u2019s grip on my hair loosened.\nWater shot out of the toilet, making an arc straight over my head, and the\nnext thing I knew, I was sprawled on the bathroom tiles with Clarisse\nscreaming behind me.\nI turned just as water blasted out of the toilet again, hitting Clarisse\nstraight in the face so hard it pushed her down onto her butt. The water\nstayed on her like the spray from a fire hose, pushing her backward into a\nshower stall.\n\nShe struggled, gasping, and her friends started coming toward her. But\nthen the other toilets exploded, too, and six more streams of toilet water\nblasted them back. The showers acted up, too, and together all the fixtures\nsprayed the camouflage girls right out of the bathroom, spinning them\naround like pieces of garbage being washed away.\nAs soon as they were out the door, I felt the tug in my gut lessen, and the\nwater shut off as quickly as it had started.\nThe entire bathroom was flooded. Annabeth hadn\u2019t been spared. She was\ndripping wet, but she hadn\u2019t been pushed out the door. She was standing in\nexactly the same place, staring at me in shock.\nI looked down and realized I was sitting in the only dry spot in the whole\nroom. There was a circle of dry floor around me. I didn\u2019t have one drop of\nwater on my clothes. Nothing.\n\n\fI stood up, my legs shaky.\nAnnabeth said, \u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nWe walked to the door. Outside, Clarisse and her friends were sprawled\nin the mud, and a bunch of other campers had gathered around to gawk.\nClarisse\u2019s hair was flattened across her face. Her camouflage jacket was\nsopping and she smelled like sewage. She gave me a look of absolute hatred.\n\u201cYou are dead, new boy.

Wherever I went,\n\ncampers pointed at me and murmured something about toilet water. Or\nmaybe they were just staring at Annabeth, who was still pretty much\ndripping wet.\nShe showed me a few more places: the metal shop (where kids were\nforging their own swords), the arts-and-crafts room (where satyrs were\nsandblasting a giant marble statue of a goat-man), and the climbing wall,\nwhich actually consisted of two facing walls that shook violently, dropped\nboulders, sprayed lava, and clashed together if you didn\u2019t get to the top fast\nenough.\nFinally we returned to the canoeing lake, where the trail led back to the\ncabins.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got training to do,\u201d Annabeth said flatly. \u201cDinner\u2019s at seven-thirty.\nJust follow your cabin to the mess hall.\u201d\n\u201cAnnabeth, I\u2019m sorry about the toilets.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d\n\n\fShe looked at me skeptically, and I realized it was my fault. I\u2019d made\nwater shoot out of the bathroom fixtures. I didn\u2019t understand how. But the\ntoilets had responded to me. I had become one with the plumbing.\n\u201cYou need to talk to the Oracle,\u201d Annabeth said.\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cNot who. What. The Oracle. I\u2019ll ask Chiron.\u201d\nI stared into the lake, wishing somebody would give me a straight\nanswer for once.\nI wasn\u2019t expecting anybody to be looking back at me from the bottom, so\nmy heart skipped a beat when I noticed two teenage girls sitting cross-legged\nat the base of the pier, about twenty feet below. They wore blue jeans and\nshimmering green T-shirts, and their brown hair floated loose around their\nshoulders as minnows darted in and out. They smiled and waved as if I were\na long-lost friend.\nI didn\u2019t know what else to do.

He loved her.\u201d\nAnnabeth gave me a cautious look. She didn\u2019t want to burst my bubble.\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. Maybe he\u2019ll send a sign. That\u2019s the only way to know\nfor sure: your father has to send you a sign claiming you as his son.\nSometimes it happens.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean sometimes it doesn\u2019t?\u201d\nAnnabeth ran her palm along the rail. \u201cThe gods are busy. They have a\nlot of kids and they don\u2019t always\u2026Well, sometimes they don\u2019t care about us,\nPercy. They ignore us.\u201d\nI thought about some of the kids I\u2019d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers\nwho looked sullen and depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that\nwould never come. I\u2019d known kids like that at Yancy Academy, shuffled off\nto boarding school by rich parents who didn\u2019t have the time to deal with\nthem. But gods should behave better.\n\u201cSo I\u2019m stuck here,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s it? For the rest of my life?\u201d\n\u201cIt depends,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cSome campers only stay for the summer.\nIf you\u2019re a child of Aphrodite or Demeter, you\u2019re probably not a real\npowerful force. The monsters might ignore you, so you can get by with a\nfew months of summer training and live in the mortal world the rest of the\n\n\fyear. But for some of us, it\u2019s too dangerous to leave. We\u2019re year-rounders. In\nthe mortal world, we attract monsters. They sense us. They come to\nchallenge us. Most of the time, they\u2019ll ignore us until we\u2019re old enough to\ncause trouble\u2014about ten or eleven years old, but after that, most demigods\neither make their way here, or they get killed off. A few manage to survive\nin the outside world and become famous. Believe me, if I told you the\nnames, you\u2019d know them. Some don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re demigods. But\nvery, very few are like that.\u201d\n\u201cSo monsters can\u2019t get in here?\u201d\nAnnabeth shook her head. \u201cNot unless they\u2019re intentionally stocked in\nthe woods or specially summoned by somebody on the inside.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would anybody want to summon a monster?\u201d\n\u201cPractice fights. Practical jokes.\u201d\n\u201cPractical jokes?\u201d\n\u201cThe point is, the borders are sealed to keep mortals and monsters out.\nFrom the outside, mortals look into the valley and see nothing unusual, just a\nstrawberry farm.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re a year-rounder?\u201d\nAnnabeth nodded. From under the collar of her T-shirt, she pulled a\nleather necklace with five clay beads of different colors.

I\u2019ve been\nhere longer than most of the counselors, and they\u2019re all in college.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you come so young?\u201d\nShe twisted the ring on her necklace. \u201cNone of your business.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh.\u201d I stood there for a minute in uncomfortable silence. \u201cSo\u2026I could\njust walk out of here right now if I wanted to?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be suicide, but you could, with Mr. D\u2019s or Chiron\u2019s permission.\nBut they wouldn\u2019t give permission until the end of the summer session\nunless\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUnless?\u201d\n\u201cYou were granted a quest. But that hardly ever happens. The last\ntime\u2026\u201d\nHer voice trailed off. I could tell from her tone that the last time hadn\u2019t\ngone well.\n\u201cBack in the sick room,\u201d I said, \u201cwhen you were feeding me that stuff\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAmbrosia.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. You asked me something about the summer solstice.\u201d\nAnnabeth\u2019s shoulders tensed. \u201cSo you do know something?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026no. Back at my old school, I overheard Grover and Chiron\ntalking about it. Grover mentioned the summer solstice. He said something\nlike we didn\u2019t have much time, because of the deadline. What did that\nmean?\u201d\nShe clenched her fists. \u201cI wish I knew. Chiron and the satyrs, they know,\nbut they won\u2019t tell me. Something is wrong in Olympus, something pretty\nmajor. Last time I was there, everything seemed so normal.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been to Olympus?\u201d\n\u201cSome of us year-rounders\u2014Luke and Clarisse and I and a few others\u2014\nwe took a field trip during winter solstice. That\u2019s when the gods have their\nbig annual council.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026how did you get there?\u201d\n\u201cThe Long Island Railroad, of course. You get off at Penn Station.\nEmpire State Building, special elevator to the six hundredth floor.\u201d She\nlooked at me like she was sure I must know this already. \u201cYou are a New\nYorker, right?\u201d\n\u201cOh, sure.\u201d As far as I knew, there were only a hundred and two floors in\nthe Empire State Building, but I decided not to point that out.\n\u201cRight after we visited,\u201d Annabeth continued, \u201cthe weather got weird, as\nif the gods had started fighting. A couple of times since, I\u2019ve overheard\nsatyrs talking. The best I can figure out is that something important was\nstolen. And if it isn\u2019t returned by summer solstice, there\u2019s going to be\ntrouble. When you came, I was hoping\u2026I mean\u2014Athena can get along with\n\n\fjust about anybody, except for Ares. And of course she\u2019s got the rivalry with\nPoseidon. But, I mean, aside from that, I thought we could work together. I\nthought you might know something.\u201d\nI shook my head. I wished I could help her, but I felt too hungry and tired\nand mentally overloaded to ask any more questions.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get a quest,\u201d Annabeth muttered to herself. \u201cI\u2019m not too\nyoung.

I left her on the pier, tracing her finger across the rail as if\ndrawing a battle plan.\nBack at cabin eleven, everybody was talking and horsing around, waiting for\ndinner. For the first time, I noticed that a lot of the campers had similar\nfeatures: sharp noses, upturned eyebrows, mischievous smiles. They were\nthe kind of kids that teachers would peg as troublemakers. Thankfully,\nnobody paid much attention to me as I walked over to my spot on the floor\nand plopped down with my minotaur horn.\nThe counselor, Luke, came over. He had the Hermes family resemblance,\ntoo. It was marred by that scar on his right cheek, but his smile was intact.\n\u201cFound you a sleeping bag,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here, I stole you some\ntoiletries from the camp store.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t tell if he was kidding about the stealing part.\nI said, \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cNo prob.\u201d Luke sat next to me, pushed his back against the wall.\n\u201cTough first day?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t belong here,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t even believe in gods.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we all started. Once you start believing in\nthem? It doesn\u2019t get any easier.\u201d\nThe bitterness in his voice surprised me, because Luke seemed like a\npretty easygoing guy. He looked like he could handle just about anything.\n\u201cSo your dad is Hermes?\u201d I asked.\nHe pulled a switchblade out of his back pocket, and for a second I\nthought he was going to gut me, but he just scraped the mud off the sole of\nhis sandal. \u201cYeah. Hermes.\u201d\n\u201cThe wing-footed messenger guy.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThat\u2019s him. Messengers. Medicine. Travelers, merchants, thieves.\nAnybody who uses the roads. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here, enjoying cabin\neleven\u2019s hospitality. Hermes isn\u2019t picky about who he sponsors.\u201d\nI figured Luke didn\u2019t mean to call me a nobody. He just had a lot on his\nmind.\n\u201cYou ever meet your dad?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOnce.\u201d\nI waited, thinking that if he wanted to tell me, he\u2019d tell me. Apparently,\nhe didn\u2019t. I wondered if the story had anything to do with how he got his\nscar.\nLuke looked up and managed a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Percy. The\ncampers here, they\u2019re mostly good people. After all, we\u2019re extended family,\nright? We take care of each other.\u201d\nHe seemed to understand how lost I felt, and I was grateful for that,\nbecause an older guy like him\u2014even if he was a counselor\u2014should\u2019ve\nsteered clear of an uncool middle-schooler like me. But Luke had welcomed\nme into the cabin. He\u2019d even stolen me some toiletries, which was the nicest\nthing anybody had done for me all day.\n\n\f\fI decided to ask him my last big question, the one that had been\nbothering me all afternoon. \u201cClarisse, from Ares, was joking about me being\n\u2018Big Three\u2019 material.

Somehow, I knew it\nwas a conch shell, even though I\u2019d never heard it before.\nLuke yelled, \u201cEleven, fall in!\u201d\nThe whole cabin, about twenty of us, filed into the commons yard. We\nlined up in order of seniority, so of course I was dead last. Campers came\nfrom the other cabins, too, except for the last three empty cabins at the end,\nand cabin eight, which had looked normal in the daytime, but was now\nstarting to glow silver as the sun went down.\nWe marched up the hill to the mess hall pavilion. Satyrs joined us from\nthe meadow. Naiads emerged from the canoeing lake. A few other girls came\nout of the woods\u2014and when I say out of the woods, I mean straight out of\nthe woods. I saw one girl, about nine or ten years old, melt from the side of a\nmaple tree and come skipping up the hill.\nIn all, there were maybe a hundred campers, a few dozen satyrs, and a\ndozen assorted wood nymphs and naiads.\nAt the pavilion, torches blazed around the marble columns. A central fire\nburned in a bronze brazier the size of a bathtub. Each cabin had its own\ntable, covered in white cloth trimmed in purple. Four of the tables were\nempty, but cabin eleven\u2019s was way overcrowded. I had to squeeze onto the\nedge of a bench with half my butt hanging off.\n\n\fI saw Grover sitting at table twelve with Mr. D, a few satyrs, and a\ncouple of plump blond boys who looked just like Mr. D. Chiron stood to one\nside, the picnic table being way too small for a centaur.\nAnnabeth sat at table six with a bunch of serious-looking athletic kids,\nall with gray eyes and honey-blond hair.\nClarisse sat behind me at Ares\u2019s table. She\u2019d apparently gotten over\nbeing hosed down, because she was laughing and belching right alongside\nher friends.\nFinally, Chiron pounded his hoof against the marble floor of the pavilion,\nand everybody fell silent. He raised a glass. \u201cTo the gods!\u201d\nEverybody else raised their glasses. \u201cTo the gods!\u201d\nWood nymphs came forward with platters of food: grapes, apples,\nstrawberries, cheese, fresh bread, and yes, barbecue!

They like the\nsmell.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d\nHis look warned me not to take this lightly, but I couldn\u2019t help\nwondering why an immortal, all-powerful being would like the smell of\nburning food.\n\n\fLuke approached the fire, bowed his head, and tossed in a cluster of fat\nred grapes. \u201cHermes.\u201d\nI was next.\nI wished I knew what god\u2019s name to say.\nFinally, I made a silent plea.

It smelled of hot chocolate and\nfresh-baked brownies, hamburgers on the grill and wildflowers, and a\nhundred other good things that shouldn\u2019t have gone well together, but did. I\ncould almost believe the gods could live off that smoke.\nWhen everybody had returned to their seats and finished eating their\nmeals, Chiron pounded his hoof again for our attention.\nMr. D got up with a huge sigh. \u201cYes, I suppose I\u2019d better say hello to all\nyou brats. Well, hello. Our activities director, Chiron, says the next capture\nthe flag is Friday. Cabin five presently holds the laurels.\u201d\nA bunch of ugly cheering rose from the Ares table.\n\u201cPersonally,\u201d Mr. D continued, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less, but congratulations.\nAlso, I should tell you that we have a new camper today. Peter Johnson.\u201d\nChiron murmured something.\n\u201cEr, Percy Jackson,\u201d Mr. D corrected. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Hurrah, and all that.\nNow run along to your silly campfire. Go on.\u201d\nEverybody cheered. We all headed down toward the amphitheater, where\nApollo\u2019s cabin led a sing-along. We sang camp songs about the gods and ate\ns\u2019mores and joked around, and the funny thing was, I didn\u2019t feel that anyone\nwas staring at me anymore. I felt that I was home.\nLater in the evening, when the sparks from the campfire were curling\ninto a starry sky, the conch horn blew again, and we all filed back to our\ncabins. I didn\u2019t realize how exhausted I was until I collapsed on my\nborrowed sleeping bag.\nMy fingers curled around the Minotaur\u2019s horn.

Chiron tried to teach me archery, but we found out\npretty quick I wasn\u2019t any good with a bow and arrow. He didn\u2019t complain,\neven when he had to desnag a stray arrow out of his tail.\n\n\fFoot racing? No good either. The wood-nymph instructors left me in the\ndust. They told me not to worry about it. They\u2019d had centuries of practice\nrunning away from lovesick gods. But still, it was a little humiliating to be\nslower than a tree.\nAnd wrestling? Forget it. Every time I got on the mat, Clarisse would\npulverize me.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more where that came from, punk,\u201d she\u2019d mumble in my ear.\nThe only thing I really excelled at was canoeing, and that wasn\u2019t the kind\nof heroic skill people expected to see from the kid who had beaten the\nMinotaur.\nI knew the senior campers and counselors were watching me, trying to\ndecide who my dad was, but they weren\u2019t having an easy time of it. I wasn\u2019t\nas strong as the Ares kids, or as good at archery as the Apollo kids. I didn\u2019t\nhave Hephaestus\u2019s skill with metalwork or\u2014gods forbid\u2014Dionysus\u2019s way\nwith vine plants. Luke told me I might be a child of Hermes, a kind of jackof-all-trades, master of none. But I got the feeling he was just trying to make\nme feel better. He really didn\u2019t know what to make of me either.\nDespite all that, I liked camp. I got used to the morning fog over the\nbeach, the smell of hot strawberry fields in the afternoon, even the weird\nnoises of monsters in the woods at night. I would eat dinner with cabin\neleven, scrape part of my meal into the fire, and try to feel some connection\nto my real dad. Nothing came. Just that warm feeling I\u2019d always had, like the\nmemory of his smile. I tried not to think too much about my mom, but I kept\nwondering: if gods and monsters were real, if all this magical stuff was\npossible, surely there was some way to save her, to bring her back\u2026.\nI started to understand Luke\u2019s bitterness and how he seemed to resent his\nfather, Hermes. So okay, maybe gods had important things to do. But\ncouldn\u2019t they call once in a while, or thunder, or something? Dionysus could\nmake Diet Coke appear out of thin air. Why couldn\u2019t my dad, whoever he\nwas, make a phone appear?\nThursday afternoon, three days after I\u2019d arrived at Camp Half-Blood, I had\nmy first sword-fighting lesson. Everybody from cabin eleven gathered in the\nbig circular arena, where Luke would be our instructor.\nWe started with basic stabbing and slashing, using some straw-stuffed\ndummies in Greek armor. I guess I did okay. At least, I understood what I\nwas supposed to do and my reflexes were good.\n\n\fThe problem was, I couldn\u2019t find a blade that felt right in my hands.\nEither they were too heavy, or too light, or too long. Luke tried his best to fix\nme up, but he agreed that none of the practice blades seemed to work for me.\nWe moved on to dueling in pairs. Luke announced he would be my\npartner, since this was my first time.\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d one of the campers told me. \u201cLuke\u2019s the best swordsman in\nthe last three hundred years.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll go easy on me,\u201d I said.\nThe camper snorted.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 135467, "end_char_idx": 139297, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ee2b2b6-1e54-4c8b-b1c7-7ea7ce6dcd02": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ee2b2b6-1e54-4c8b-b1c7-7ea7ce6dcd02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8622e940-47f6-4cf6-afcb-237e747fd9a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "ab0775e8c8aeb5fb75aaa3a774888339ee5e4aca59c8a8360f76007f8754fbb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "27acf933-f074-4461-9b0a-86e0ee9bc595", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "06be3dcb7d2d48e9899a0acaded53c443649e372c34acf08ef3ffe6c404f3ca4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Everybody from cabin eleven gathered in the\nbig circular arena, where Luke would be our instructor.\nWe started with basic stabbing and slashing, using some straw-stuffed\ndummies in Greek armor.

The sword\ndidn\u2019t feel so awkward.\n\u201cOkay, everybody circle up!\u201d Luke ordered. \u201cIf Percy doesn\u2019t mind, I\nwant to give you a little demo.\u201d\nGreat, I thought. Let\u2019s all watch Percy get pounded.\nThe Hermes guys gathered around. They were suppressing smiles. I\nfigured they\u2019d been in my shoes before and couldn\u2019t wait to see how Luke\nused me for a punching bag. He told everybody he was going to demonstrate\na disarming technique: how to twist the enemy\u2019s blade with the flat of your\nown sword so that he had no choice but to drop his weapon.\n\u201cThis is difficult,\u201d he stressed. \u201cI\u2019ve had it used against me. No laughing\nat Percy, now. Most swordsmen have to work years to master this\ntechnique.\u201d\nHe demonstrated the move on me in slow motion. Sure enough, the\nsword clattered out of my hand.\n\u201cNow in real time,\u201d he said, after I\u2019d retrieved my weapon. \u201cWe keep\nsparring until one of us pulls it off. Ready, Percy?\u201d\nI nodded, and Luke came after me. Somehow, I kept him from getting a\nshot at the hilt of my sword. My senses opened up. I saw his attacks coming.\nI countered. I stepped forward and tried a thrust of my own. Luke deflected\n\n\fit easily, but I saw a change in his face. His eyes narrowed, and he started to\npress me with more force.\n\n\f\fThe sword grew heavy in my hand. The balance wasn\u2019t right. I knew it\nwas only a matter of seconds before Luke took me down, so I figured, What\nthe heck?\nI tried the disarming maneuver.\nMy blade hit the base of Luke\u2019s and I twisted, putting my whole weight\ninto a downward thrust.\nClang.\nLuke\u2019s sword rattled against the stones. The tip of my blade was an inch\nfrom his undefended chest.\nThe other campers were silent.\nI lowered my sword. \u201cUm, sorry.\u201d\nFor a moment, Luke was too stunned to speak.\n\u201cSorry?\u201d His scarred face broke into a grin. \u201cBy the gods, Percy, why are\nyou sorry? Show me that again!\u201d\nI didn\u2019t want to. The short burst of manic energy had completely\nabandoned me. But Luke insisted.\nThis time, there was no contest.

So did you\nget it?\u201d\nGrover looked down at the naiads. \u201cMr. D suspended judgment. He said\nI hadn\u2019t failed or succeeded with you yet, so our fates were still tied together.\nIf you got a quest and I went along to protect you, and we both came back\nalive, then maybe he\u2019d consider the job complete.\u201d\nMy spirits lifted. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not so bad, right?\u201d\n\u201cBlaa-ha-ha!

We talked about canoeing and swordplay for a while,\nthen debated the pros and cons of the different gods. Finally, I asked him\nabout the four empty cabins.\n\u201cNumber eight, the silver one, belongs to Artemis,\u201d he said. \u201cShe vowed\nto be a maiden forever. So of course, no kids. The cabin is, you know,\nhonorary. If she didn\u2019t have one, she\u2019d be mad.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, okay. But the other three, the ones at the end. Are those the Big\nThree?\u201d\nGrover tensed. We were getting close to a touchy subject. \u201cNo. One of\nthem, number two, is Hera\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s another honorary thing. She\u2019s\nthe goddess of marriage, so of course she wouldn\u2019t go around having affairs\nwith mortals. That\u2019s her husband\u2019s job.

They were affecting the course of\nhuman events too much, causing too much carnage. World War II, you know,\nthat was basically a fight between the sons of Zeus and Poseidon on one\nside, and the sons of Hades on the other. The winning side, Zeus and\nPoseidon, made Hades swear an oath with them: no more affairs with mortal\nwomen. They all swore on the River Styx.\u201d\nThunder boomed.\nI said, \u201cThat\u2019s the most serious oath you can make.\u201d\nGrover nodded.\n\u201cAnd the brothers kept their word\u2014no kids?\u201d\nGrover\u2019s face darkened. \u201cSeventeen years ago, Zeus fell off the wagon.\nThere was this TV starlet with a big fluffy eighties hairdo\u2014he just couldn\u2019t\nhelp himself. When their child was born, a little girl named Thalia\u2026well, the\nRiver Styx is serious about promises. Zeus himself got off easy because he\u2019s\nimmortal, but he brought a terrible fate on his daughter.\u201d\n\u201cBut that isn\u2019t fair! It wasn\u2019t the little girl\u2019s fault.\u201d\nGrover hesitated. \u201cPercy, children of the Big Three have powers greater\nthan other half-bloods. They have a strong aura, a scent that attracts\nmonsters. When Hades found out about the girl, he wasn\u2019t too happy about\nZeus breaking his oath. Hades let the worst monsters out of Tartarus to\ntorment Thalia. A satyr was assigned to be her keeper when she was twelve,\nbut there was nothing he could do. He tried to escort her here with a couple\nof other half-bloods she\u2019d befriended. They almost made it. They got all the\nway to the top of that hill.\u201d\nHe pointed across the valley, to the pine tree where I\u2019d fought the\nminotaur. \u201cAll three Kindly Ones were after them, along with a horde of\nhellhounds. They were about to be overrun when Thalia told her satyr to take\nthe other two half-bloods to safety while she held off the monsters. She was\nwounded and tired, and she didn\u2019t want to live like a hunted animal. The\nsatyr didn\u2019t want to leave her, but he couldn\u2019t change her mind, and he had\nto protect the others. So Thalia made her final stand alone, at the top of that\nhill. As she died, Zeus took pity on her. He turned her into that pine tree. Her\n\n\fspirit still helps protect the borders of the valley. That\u2019s why the hill is called\nHalf-Blood Hill.\u201d\nI stared at the pine in the distance.\nThe story made me feel hollow, and guilty too. A girl my age had\nsacrificed herself to save her friends. She had faced a whole army of\nmonsters. Next to that, my victory over the Minotaur didn\u2019t seem like much.\nI wondered, if I\u2019d acted differently, could I have saved my mother?\n\u201cGrover,\u201d I said, \u201chave heroes really gone on quests to the Underworld?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cOrpheus.

Her spear stuck me straight in the ribs. If I\nhadn\u2019t been wearing an armored breastplate, I would\u2019ve been shish-kebabbed.

You corpse-breath worm!\u201d\nShe probably would\u2019ve said worse, but I smacked her between the eyes\nwith my sword-butt and sent her stumbling backward out of the creek.\n\n\fThen I heard yelling, elated screams, and I saw Luke racing toward the\nboundary line with the red team\u2019s banner lifted high. He was flanked by a\ncouple of Hermes guys covering his retreat, and a few Apollos behind them,\nfighting off the Hephaestus kids. The Ares folks got up, and Clarisse\nmuttered a dazed curse.\n\u201cA trick!\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt was a trick.\u201d\nThey staggered after Luke, but it was too late. Everybody converged on\nthe creek as Luke ran across into friendly territory. Our side exploded into\ncheers. The red banner shimmered and turned to silver. The boar and spear\nwere replaced with a huge caduceus, the symbol of cabin eleven. Everybody\non the blue team picked up Luke and started carrying him around on their\nshoulders. Chiron cantered out from the woods and blew the conch horn.\nThe game was over. We\u2019d won.\nI was about to join the celebration when Annabeth\u2019s voice, right next to\nme in the creek, said, \u201cNot bad, hero.\u201d\nI looked, but she wasn\u2019t there.\n\u201cWhere the heck did you learn to fight like that?\u201d she asked. The air\nshimmered, and she materialized, holding a Yankees baseball cap as if she\u2019d\njust taken it off her head.\nI felt myself getting angry. I wasn\u2019t even fazed by the fact that she\u2019d just\nbeen invisible. \u201cYou set me up,\u201d I said. \u201cYou put me here because you knew\nClarisse would come after me, while you sent Luke around the flank. You\nhad it all figured out.\u201d\nAnnabeth shrugged. \u201cI told you. Athena always, always has a plan.\u201d\n\u201cA plan to get me pulverized.\u201d\n\u201cI came as fast as I could. I was about to jump in, but\u2026\u201d She shrugged.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need help.\u201d\nThen she noticed my wounded arm. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\n\u201cSword cut,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It was a sword cut. Look at it.\u201d\nThe blood was gone. Where the huge cut had been, there was a long\nwhite scratch, and even that was fading. As I watched, it turned into a small\nscar, and disappeared.\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t get it,\u201d I said.\nAnnabeth was thinking hard. I could almost see the gears turning. She\nlooked down at my feet, then at Clarisse\u2019s broken spear, and said, \u201cStep out\nof the water, Percy.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust do it.\u201d\nI came out of the creek and immediately felt bone tired. My arms started\nto go numb again. My adrenaline rush left me. I almost fell over, but\nAnnabeth steadied me.\n\u201cOh, Styx,\u201d she cursed. \u201cThis is not good. I didn\u2019t want\u2026I assumed it\nwould be Zeus\u2026.\u201d\nBefore I could ask what she meant, I heard that canine growl again, but\nmuch closer than before. A howl ripped through the forest.\nThe campers\u2019 cheering died instantly. Chiron shouted something in\nancient Greek, which I would realize, only later, I had understood perfectly:\n\u201cStand ready! My bow!\u201d\nAnnabeth drew her sword.\nThere on the rocks just above us was a black hound the size of a rhino,\nwith lava-red eyes and fangs like daggers.\nIt was looking straight at me.\nNobody moved except Annabeth, who yelled, \u201cPercy, run!\u201d\nShe tried to step in front of me, but the hound was too fast.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 156653, "end_char_idx": 160307, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c905e475-2726-4807-9d71-009e8b20a080": {"__data__": {"id_": "c905e475-2726-4807-9d71-009e8b20a080", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f4a328b-3a9b-4210-8a3c-797b8028745a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "2262debe09e752760998c47769c58a9c604fc6cc72b322aee498ab04ccb29da7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bdde92ca-5278-440c-b8b4-e024a899c248", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3809ac56a25d3f248881b9120bed9fd67e66ff25775a6ac765d0d17690ad1ec6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "My adrenaline rush left me.

The family\u2019s badly burned \u201978 Camaro was\ndiscovered last Saturday on a north Long Island road with the roof\nripped off and the front axle broken. The car had flipped and skidded\nfor several hundred feet before exploding.\nMother and son had gone for a weekend vacation to Montauk, but\nleft hastily, under mysterious circumstances. Small traces of blood\nwere found in the car and near the scene of the wreck, but there were\nno other signs of the missing Jacksons. Residents in the rural area\nreported seeing nothing unusual around the time of the accident.\n\n\fMs. Jackson\u2019s husband, Gabe Ugliano, claims that his stepson,\nPercy Jackson, is a troubled child who has been kicked out of\nnumerous boarding schools and has expressed violent tendencies in the\npast.\nPolice would not say whether son Percy is a suspect in his mother\u2019s\ndisappearance, but they have not ruled out foul play. Below are recent\npictures of Sally Jackson and Percy. Police urge anyone with\ninformation to call the following toll-free crime-stoppers hotline.\nThe phone number was circled in black marker.\nI wadded up the paper and threw it away, then flopped down in my bunk\nbed in the middle of my empty cabin.\n\u201cLights out,\u201d I told myself miserably.\nThat night, I had my worst dream yet.\nI was running along the beach in a storm. This time, there was a city\nbehind me. Not New York.

This time, there was a city\nbehind me. Not New York. The sprawl was different: buildings spread\nfarther apart, palm trees and low hills in the distance.\nAbout a hundred yards down the surf, two men were fighting. They\nlooked like TV wrestlers, muscular, with beards and long hair. Both wore\nflowing Greek tunics, one trimmed in blue, the other in green. They grappled\nwith each other, wrestled, kicked and head-butted, and every time they\nconnected, lightning flashed, the sky grew darker, and the wind rose.\n\n\fI had to stop them. I didn\u2019t know why. But the harder I ran, the more the\nwind blew me back, until I was running in place, my heels digging uselessly\nin the sand.\nOver the roar of the storm, I could hear the blue-robed one yelling at the\ngreen-robed one, Give it back! Give it back! Like a kindergartner fighting\nover a toy.\nThe waves got bigger, crashing into the beach, spraying me with salt.\nI yelled, Stop it! Stop fighting!\nThe ground shook. Laughter came from somewhere under the earth, and\na voice so deep and evil it turned my blood to ice.\nCome down, little hero, the voice crooned. Come down!\nThe sand split beneath me, opening up a crevice straight down to the\ncenter of the earth. My feet slipped, and darkness swallowed me.\nI woke up, sure I was falling.\nI was still in bed in cabin three. My body told me it was morning, but it\nwas dark outside, and thunder rolled across the hills. A storm was brewing. I\nhadn\u2019t dreamed that.\nI heard a clopping sound at the door, a hoof knocking on the threshold.\n\u201cCome in?\u201d\nGrover trotted inside, looking worried. \u201cMr. D wants to see you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cHe wants to kill\u2026I mean, I\u2019d better let him tell you.\u201d\nNervously, I got dressed and followed, sure that I was in huge trouble.\nFor days, I\u2019d been half expecting a summons to the Big House. Now that\nI was declared a son of Poseidon, one of the Big Three gods who weren\u2019t\nsupposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive. The\nother gods had probably been debating the best way to punish me for\nexisting, and now Mr. D was ready to deliver their verdict.\nOver Long Island Sound, the sky looked like ink soup coming to a boil.\nA hazy curtain of rain was coming in our direction. I asked Grover if we\nneeded an umbrella.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt never rains here unless we want it to.\u201d\nI pointed at the storm. \u201cWhat the heck is that, then?\u201d\nHe glanced uneasily at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019ll pass around us. Bad weather always\ndoes.\u201d\nI realized he was right. In the week I\u2019d been here, it had never even been\novercast. The few rain clouds I\u2019d seen had skirted right around the edges of\n\n\fthe valley.\nBut this storm\u2026this one was huge.\nAt the volleyball pit, the kids from Apollo\u2019s cabin were playing a\nmorning game against the satyrs. Dionysus\u2019s twins were walking around in\nthe strawberry fields, making the plants grow. Everybody was going about\ntheir normal business, but they looked tense.

Your father and Zeus are having their\nworst quarrel in centuries. They are fighting over something valuable that\nwas stolen. To be precise: a lightning bolt.\u201d\nI laughed nervously. \u201cA what?\u201d\n\u201cDo not take this lightly,\u201d Chiron warned. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about some\ntinfoil-covered zigzag you\u2019d see in a second-grade play. I\u2019m talking about a\ntwo-foot-long cylinder of high-grade celestial bronze, capped on both ends\nwith god-level explosives.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cZeus\u2019s master bolt,\u201d Chiron said, getting worked up now. \u201cThe symbol\nof his power, from which all other lightning bolts are patterned. The first\nweapon made by the Cyclopes for the war against the Titans, the bolt that\nsheared the top off Mount Etna and hurled Kronos from his throne; the\nmaster bolt, which packs enough power to make mortal hydrogen bombs\nlook like firecrackers.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s missing?\u201d\n\u201cStolen,\u201d Chiron said.\n\u201cBy who?\u201d\n\u201cBy whom,\u201d Chiron corrected. Once a teacher, always a teacher. \u201cBy\nyou.\u201d\nMy mouth fell open.\n\n\f\u201cAt least\u201d\u2014Chiron held up a hand\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s what Zeus thinks. During the\nwinter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an\nargument. The usual nonsense: \u2018Mother Rhea always liked you best,\u2019 \u2018Air\ndisasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,\u2019 et cetera. Afterward, Zeus\nrealized his master bolt was missing, taken from the throne room under his\nvery nose. He immediately blamed Poseidon. Now, a god cannot usurp\nanother god\u2019s symbol of power directly\u2014that is forbidden by the most\nancient of divine laws. But Zeus believes your father convinced a human\nhero to take it.\u201d\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPatience and listen, child,\u201d Chiron said. \u201cZeus has good reason to be\nsuspicious. The forges of the Cyclopes are under the ocean, which gives\nPoseidon some influence over the makers of his brother\u2019s lightning. Zeus\nbelieves Poseidon has taken the master bolt, and is now secretly having the\nCyclopes build an arsenal of illegal copies, which might be used to topple\nZeus from his throne. The only thing Zeus wasn\u2019t sure about was which hero\nPoseidon used to steal the bolt. Now Poseidon has openly claimed you as his\nson. You were in New York over the winter holidays. You could easily have\nsnuck into Olympus. Zeus believes he has found his thief.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve never even been to Olympus! Zeus is crazy!\u201d\nChiron and Grover glanced nervously at the sky. The clouds didn\u2019t seem\nto be parting around us, as Grover had promised. They were rolling straight\nover our valley, sealing us in like a coffin lid.\n\u201cEr, Percy\u2026?\u201d Grover said. \u201cWe don\u2019t use the c-word to describe the\nLord of the Sky.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps paranoid,\u201d Chiron suggested. \u201cThen again, Poseidon has tried\nto unseat Zeus before.

I couldn\u2019t\neven steal a slice of pizza from Gabe\u2019s poker party without getting busted.\nChiron was waiting for an answer.\n\u201cSomething about a golden net?\u201d I guessed. \u201cPoseidon and Hera and a\nfew other gods\u2026they, like, trapped Zeus and wouldn\u2019t let him out until he\npromised to be a better ruler, right?\u201d\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Chiron said. \u201cAnd Zeus has never trusted Poseidon since. Of\ncourse, Poseidon denies stealing the master bolt. He took great offense at the\n\n\faccusation. The two have been arguing back and forth for months,\nthreatening war. And now, you\u2019ve come along\u2014the proverbial last straw.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m just a kid!\u201d\n\u201cPercy,\u201d Grover cut in, \u201cif you were Zeus, and you already thought your\nbrother was plotting to overthrow you, then your brother suddenly admitted\nhe had broken the sacred oath he took after World War II, that he\u2019s fathered a\nnew mortal hero who might be used as a weapon against you\u2026Wouldn\u2019t that\nput a twist in your toga?\u201d\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t do anything. Poseidon\u2014my dad\u2014he didn\u2019t really have this\nmaster bolt stolen, did he?\u201d\nChiron sighed. \u201cMost thinking observers would agree that thievery is not\nPoseidon\u2019s style. But the Sea God is too proud to try convincing Zeus of\nthat. Zeus has demanded that Poseidon return the bolt by the summer\nsolstice. That\u2019s June twenty-first, ten days from now. Poseidon wants an\napology for being called a thief by the same date. I hoped that diplomacy\nmight prevail, that Hera or Demeter or Hestia would make the two brothers\nsee sense. But your arrival has inflamed Zeus\u2019s temper. Now neither god will\nback down. Unless someone intervenes, unless the master bolt is found and\nreturned to Zeus before the solstice, there will be war. And do you know\nwhat a full-fledged war would look like, Percy?\u201d\n\u201cBad?\u201d I guessed.\n\u201cImagine the world in chaos. Nature at war with itself. Olympians forced\nto choose sides between Zeus and Poseidon. Destruction. Carnage. Millions\ndead. Western civilization turned into a battleground so big it will make the\nTrojan War look like a water-balloon fight.\u201d\n\u201cBad,\u201d I repeated.\n\u201cAnd you, Percy Jackson, would be the first to feel Zeus\u2019s wrath.\u201d\nIt started to rain. Volleyball players stopped their game and stared in\nstunned silence at the sky.\nI had brought this storm to Half-Blood Hill. Zeus was punishing the\nwhole camp because of me. I was furious.\n\u201cSo I have to find the stupid bolt,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd return it to Zeus.\u201d\n\u201cWhat better peace offering,\u201d Chiron said, \u201cthan to have the son of\nPoseidon return Zeus\u2019s property?\u201d\n\u201cIf Poseidon doesn\u2019t have it, where is the thing?\u201d\n\u201cI believe I know.\u201d Chiron\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cPart of a prophecy I\nhad years ago\u2026well, some of the lines make sense to me, now.

The door swung down, and a wooden ladder clattered\ninto place.\nThe warm air from above smelled like mildew and rotten wood and\nsomething else\u2026a smell I remembered from biology class. Reptiles. The\nsmell of snakes.\nI held my breath and climbed.\nThe attic was filled with Greek hero junk: armor stands covered in\ncobwebs; once-bright shields pitted with rust; old leather steamer trunks\nplastered with stickers saying ITHAKA, CIRCE\u2019S ISLE, and LAND OF THE\nAMAZONS. One long table was stacked with glass jars filled with pickled\nthings\u2014severed hairy claws, huge yellow eyes, various other parts of\nmonsters. A dusty mounted trophy on the wall looked like a giant snake\u2019s\nhead, but with horns and a full set of shark\u2019s teeth. The plaque read, HYDRA\nHEAD #I, WOODSTOCK, N.Y., 1969.\nBy the window, sitting on a wooden tripod stool, was the most gruesome\nmemento of all: a mummy. Not the wrapped-in-cloth kind, but a human\nfemale body shriveled to a husk. She wore a tie-dyed sundress, lots of\nbeaded necklaces, and a headband over long black hair. The skin of her face\nwas thin and leathery over her skull, and her eyes were glassy white slits, as\nif the real eyes had been replaced by marbles; she\u2019d been dead a long, long\ntime.\nLooking at her sent chills up my back. And that was before she sat up on\nher stool and opened her mouth. A green mist poured from the mummy\u2019s\n\n\fmouth, coiling over the floor in thick tendrils, hissing like twenty thousand\nsnakes. I stumbled over myself trying to get to the trapdoor, but it slammed\nshut. Inside my head, I heard a voice, slithering into one ear and coiling\naround my brain: I am the spirit of Delphi, speaker of the prophecies of\nPhoebus Apollo, slayer of the mighty Python. Approach, seeker, and ask.\nI wanted to say, No thanks, wrong door, just looking for the bathroom.\nBut I forced myself to take a deep breath.\nThe mummy wasn\u2019t alive. She was some kind of gruesome receptacle for\nsomething else, the power that was now swirling around me in the green\nmist. But its presence didn\u2019t feel evil, like my demonic math teacher Mrs.\nDodds or the Minotaur. It felt more like the Three Fates I\u2019d seen knitting the\nyarn outside the highway fruit stand: ancient, powerful, and definitely not\nhuman. But not particularly interested in killing me, either.\nI got up the courage to ask, \u201cWhat is my destiny?\u201d\nThe mist swirled more thickly, collecting right in front of me and around\nthe table with the pickled monster-part jars.

Maine\u2019s very nice this time of year.\u201d\n\u201cHades sent a minion to steal the master bolt,\u201d Chiron insisted. \u201cHe hid it\nin the Underworld, knowing full well that Zeus would blame Poseidon. I\ndon\u2019t pretend to understand the Lord of the Dead\u2019s motives perfectly, or why\nhe chose this time to start a war, but one thing is certain. Percy must go to\nthe Underworld, find the master bolt, and reveal the truth.\u201d\nA strange fire burned in my stomach. The weirdest thing was: it wasn\u2019t\nfear. It was anticipation. The desire for revenge. Hades had tried to kill me\nthree times so far, with the Fury, the Minotaur, and the hellhound. It was his\nfault my mother had disappeared in a flash of light. Now he was trying to\nframe me and my dad for a theft we hadn\u2019t committed.\nI was ready to take him on.\nBesides, if my mother was in the Underworld\u2026\nWhoa, boy, said the small part of my brain that was still sane. You\u2019re a\nkid. Hades is a god.\nGrover was trembling. He\u2019d started eating pinochle cards like potato\nchips.\nThe poor guy needed to complete a quest with me so he could get his\nsearcher\u2019s license, whatever that was, but how could I ask him to do this\nquest, especially when the Oracle said I was destined to fail? This was\nsuicide.\n\u201cLook, if we know it\u2019s Hades,\u201d I told Chiron, \u201cwhy can\u2019t we just tell the\nother gods? Zeus or Poseidon could go down to the Underworld and bust\nsome heads.\u201d\n\u201cSuspecting and knowing are not the same,\u201d Chiron said. \u201cBesides, even\nif the other gods suspect Hades\u2014and I imagine Poseidon does\u2014they\ncouldn\u2019t retrieve the bolt themselves. Gods cannot cross each other\u2019s\nterritories except by invitation. That is another ancient rule. Heroes, on the\n\n\fother hand, have certain privileges. They can go anywhere, challenge\nanyone, as long as they\u2019re bold enough and strong enough to do it. No god\ncan be held responsible for a hero\u2019s actions. Why do you think the gods\nalways operate through humans?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m being used.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying it\u2019s no accident Poseidon has claimed you now. It\u2019s a very\nrisky gamble, but he\u2019s in a desperate situation. He needs you.\u201d\nMy dad needs me.\nEmotions rolled around inside me like bits of glass in a kaleidoscope. I\ndidn\u2019t know whether to feel resentful or grateful or happy or angry. Poseidon\nhad ignored me for twelve years.

Why do you think the gods\nalways operate through humans?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m being used.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying it\u2019s no accident Poseidon has claimed you now. It\u2019s a very\nrisky gamble, but he\u2019s in a desperate situation. He needs you.\u201d\nMy dad needs me.\nEmotions rolled around inside me like bits of glass in a kaleidoscope. I\ndidn\u2019t know whether to feel resentful or grateful or happy or angry. Poseidon\nhad ignored me for twelve years. Now suddenly he needed me.\nI looked at Chiron. \u201cYou\u2019ve known I was Poseidon\u2019s son all along,\nhaven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI had my suspicions. As I said\u2026I\u2019ve spoken to the Oracle, too.\u201d\nI got the feeling there was a lot he wasn\u2019t telling me about his prophecy,\nbut I decided I couldn\u2019t worry about that right now. After all, I was holding\nback information too.\n\u201cSo let me get this straight,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to go to the\nUnderworld and confront the Lord of the Dead.\u201d\n\u201cCheck,\u201d Chiron said.\n\u201cFind the most powerful weapon in the universe.\u201d\n\u201cCheck.\u201d\n\u201cAnd get it back to Olympus before the summer solstice, in ten days.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s about right.\u201d\nI looked at Grover, who gulped down the ace of hearts.\n\u201cDid I mention that Maine is very nice this time of year?\u201d he asked\nweakly.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go,\u201d I told him. \u201cI can\u2019t ask that of you.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d He shifted his hooves. \u201cNo\u2026it\u2019s just that satyrs and\nunderground places\u2026well\u2026\u201d\nHe took a deep breath, then stood, brushing the shredded cards and\naluminum bits off his T-shirt. \u201cYou saved my life, Percy. If\u2026if you\u2019re\nserious about wanting me along, I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d\nI felt so relieved I wanted to cry, though I didn\u2019t think that would be very\nheroic. Grover was the only friend I\u2019d ever had for longer than a few\nmonths. I wasn\u2019t sure what good a satyr could do against the forces of the\ndead, but I felt better knowing he\u2019d be with me.\n\n\f\u201cAll the way, G-man.\u201d I turned to Chiron. \u201cSo where do we go? The\nOracle just said to go west.\u201d\n\u201cThe entrance to the Underworld is always in the west. It moves from\nage to age, just like Olympus. Right now, of course, it\u2019s in America.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\nChiron looked surprised. \u201cI thought that would be obvious enough. The\nentrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cNaturally. So we just get on a plane\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Grover shrieked. \u201cPercy, what are you thinking? Have you ever\nbeen on a plane in your life?\u201d\nI shook my head, feeling embarrassed. My mom had never taken me\nanywhere by plane. She\u2019d always said we didn\u2019t have the money. Besides,\nher parents had died in a plane crash.\n\u201cPercy, think,\u201d Chiron said. \u201cYou are the son of the Sea God. Your\nfather\u2019s bitterest rival is Zeus, Lord of the Sky. Your mother knew better than\nto trust you in an airplane. You would be in Zeus\u2019s domain. You would never\ncome down again alive.\u201d\nOverhead, lightning crackled. Thunder boomed.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, determined not to look at the storm. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll travel\noverland.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Chiron said. \u201cTwo companions may accompany you.\nGrover is one. The other has already volunteered, if you will accept her\nhelp.\u201d\n\u201cGee,\u201d I said, feigning surprise. \u201cWho else would be stupid enough to\nvolunteer for a quest like this?\u201d\nThe air shimmered behind Chiron.\nAnnabeth became visible, stuffing her Yankees cap into her back pocket.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting a long time for a quest, Seaweed Brain,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAthena is no fan of Poseidon, but if you\u2019re going to save the world, I\u2019m the\nbest person to keep you from messing up.\u201d\n\u201cIf you do say so yourself,\u201d I said.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 187052, "end_char_idx": 190799, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56cb1ce9-0945-48c8-b2e3-88e4d7969e2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "56cb1ce9-0945-48c8-b2e3-88e4d7969e2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "329a92cf-2a48-432e-82b2-e0f19cfd2acd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "5e28aca34c73d213469ab8d86695e36ea7a4ef70a51d5d34732faffadce571be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "64de9f4f-a249-4946-9255-7b23c68a5323", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "29e868872ccac7f8c4b6882edb7f57ef193f82eec24e5918815a6264dc93f0c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "You would never\ncome down again alive.\u201d\nOverhead, lightning crackled.

I decided to leave the Minotaur horn in my\n\ncabin, which left me only an extra change of clothes and a toothbrush to stuff\nin a backpack Grover had found for me.\nThe camp store loaned me one hundred dollars in mortal money and\ntwenty golden drachmas. These coins were as big as Girl Scout cookies and\nhad images of various Greek gods stamped on one side and the Empire State\nBuilding on the other. The ancient mortal drachmas had been silver, Chiron\ntold us, but Olympians never used less than pure gold. Chiron said the coins\nmight come in handy for non-mortal transactions\u2014whatever that meant. He\ngave Annabeth and me each a canteen of nectar and a Ziploc bag full of\nambrosia squares, to be used only in emergencies, if we were seriously hurt.\nIt was god food, Chiron reminded us. It would cure us of almost any injury,\nbut it was lethal to mortals. Too much of it would make a half-blood very,\nvery feverish. An overdose would burn us up, literally.\nAnnabeth was bringing her magic Yankees cap, which she told me had\nbeen a twelfth-birthday present from her mom. She carried a book on famous\nclassical architecture, written in Ancient Greek, to read when she got bored,\nand a long bronze knife, hidden in her shirt sleeve. I was sure the knife\nwould get us busted the first time we went through a metal detector.\nGrover wore his fake feet and his pants to pass as human. He wore a\ngreen rasta-style cap, because when it rained his curly hair flattened and you\n\n\fcould just see the tips of his horns. His bright orange backpack was full of\nscrap metal and apples to snack on. In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his\ndaddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs:\nMozart\u2019s Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff\u2019s \u201cSo Yesterday,\u201d both of\nwhich sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.\nWe waved good-bye to the other campers, took one last look at the\nstrawberry fields, the ocean, and the Big House, then hiked up Half-Blood\nHill to the tall pine tree that used to be Thalia, daughter of Zeus.\nChiron was waiting for us in his wheelchair.

I\u2019d been afraid he might resent me for getting so much attention\n\n\fthe last few days. But here he was giving me a magic gift\u2026.It made me\nblush almost as much as Annabeth.\n\u201cHey, man,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cListen, Percy\u2026\u201d Luke looked uncomfortable. \u201cA lot of hopes are riding\non you.

You\nare the one.\u201d\nI remembered the field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, when I\u2019d\nvaporized Mrs. Dodds. Chiron had thrown me a pen that turned into a sword.\nCould this be\u2026?\nI took off the cap, and the pen grew longer and heavier in my hand. In\nhalf a second, I held a shimmering bronze sword with a double-edged blade,\na leather-wrapped grip, and a flat hilt riveted with gold studs. It was the first\nweapon that actually felt balanced in my hand.\n\u201cThe sword has a long and tragic history that we need not go into,\u201d\nChiron told me. \u201cIts name is Anaklusmos.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Riptide,\u2019\u201d I translated, surprised the Ancient Greek came so easily.\n\u201cUse it only for emergencies,\u201d Chiron said, \u201cand only against monsters.\nNo hero should harm mortals unless absolutely necessary, of course, but this\nsword wouldn\u2019t harm them in any case.\u201d\nI looked at the wickedly sharp blade. \u201cWhat do you mean it wouldn\u2019t\nharm mortals? How could it not?\u201d\n\u201cThe sword is celestial bronze. Forged by the Cyclopes, tempered in the\nheart of Mount Etna, cooled in the River Lethe. It\u2019s deadly to monsters, to\nany creature from the Underworld, provided they don\u2019t kill you first. But the\nblade will pass though mortals like an illusion. They simply are not\nimportant enough for the blade to kill. And I should warn you: as a demigod,\nyou can be killed by either celestial or normal weapons. You are twice as\nvulnerable.\u201d\n\u201cGood to know.\u201d\n\u201cNow recap the pen.\u201d\n\n\fI touched the pen cap to the sword tip and instantly Riptide shrank to a\nballpoint pen again. I tucked it in my pocket, a little nervous, because I was\nfamous for losing pens at school.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Chiron said.\n\u201cCan\u2019t what?\u201d\n\u201cLose the pen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is enchanted. It will always reappear in your\npocket. Try it.\u201d\nI was wary, but I threw the pen as far as I could down the hill and\nwatched it disappear in the grass.\n\u201cIt may take a few moments,\u201d Chiron told me. \u201cNow check your\npocket.\u201d\nSure enough, the pen was there.\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s extremely cool,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut what if a mortal sees me\npulling out a sword?\u201d\nChiron smiled. \u201cMist is a powerful thing, Percy.\u201d\n\u201cMist?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Read The Iliad. It\u2019s full of references to the stuff. Whenever divine\nor monstrous elements mix with the mortal world, they generate Mist, which\nobscures the vision of humans. You will see things just as they are, being a\nhalf-blood, but humans will interpret things quite differently. Remarkable,\nreally, the lengths to which humans will go to fit things into their version of\nreality.\u201d\nI put Riptide back in my pocket.\nFor the first time, the quest felt real. I was actually leaving Half-Blood\nHill. I was heading west with no adult supervision, no backup plan, not even\na cell phone. (Chiron said cell phones were traceable by monsters; if we used\none, it would be worse than sending up a flare.) I had no weapon stronger\nthan a sword to fight off monsters and reach the Land of the Dead.\n\u201cChiron\u2026\u201d I said. \u201cWhen you say the gods are immortal\u2026I mean, there\nwas a time before them, right?\u201d\n\u201cFour ages before them, actually.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 196307, "end_char_idx": 200043, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56d7c0aa-c2e1-4738-98e4-ac06e310d14b": {"__data__": {"id_": "56d7c0aa-c2e1-4738-98e4-ac06e310d14b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "115d7224-5b41-4145-9cb3-4c14d4b34ef7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "5227a5781ce384f3a662f46c8318a60b67cf66258a04d729ab17f69d25ce8c92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c968bba4-cc1c-4b87-bffb-828703a4773c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7e4bef07bef3c7863acd2d470bae9b00a5aab1883ff18869107a2ce9d800a253", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "You will see things just as they are, being a\nhalf-blood, but humans will interpret things quite differently.

The Time of the Titans was the Fourth\nAge, sometimes called the Golden Age, which is definitely a misnomer.\nThis, the time of Western civilization and the rule of Zeus, is the Fifth Age.\u201d\n\u201cSo what was it like\u2026before the gods?\u201d\nChiron pursed his lips. \u201cEven I am not old enough to remember that,\nchild, but I know it was a time of darkness and savagery for mortals. Kronos,\nthe lord of the Titans, called his reign the Golden Age because men lived\n\n\finnocent and free of all knowledge. But that was mere propaganda. The\nTitan king cared nothing for your kind except as appetizers or a source of\ncheap entertainment. It was only in the early reign of Lord Zeus, when\nPrometheus the good Titan brought fire to mankind, that your species began\nto progress, and even then Prometheus was branded a radical thinker. Zeus\npunished him severely, as you may recall. Of course, eventually the gods\nwarmed to humans, and Western civilization was born.\u201d\n\u201cBut the gods can\u2019t die now, right? I mean, as long as Western\ncivilization is alive, they\u2019re alive. So\u2026even if I failed, nothing could happen\nso bad it would mess up everything, right?\u201d\nChiron gave me a melancholy smile. \u201cNo one knows how long the Age\nof the West will last, Percy. The gods are immortal, yes. But then, so were\nthe Titans. They still exist, locked away in their various prisons, forced to\nendure endless pain and punishment, reduced in power, but still very much\nalive. May the Fates forbid that the gods should ever suffer such a doom, or\nthat we should ever return to the darkness and chaos of the past. All we can\ndo, child, is follow our destiny.\u201d\n\u201cOur destiny\u2026assuming we know what that is.\u201d\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Chiron told me. \u201cKeep a clear head. And remember, you may\nbe about to prevent the biggest war in human history.\u201d\n\u201cRelax,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m very relaxed.\u201d\nWhen I got to the bottom of the hill, I looked back. Under the pine tree\nthat used to be Thalia, daughter of Zeus, Chiron was now standing in full\nhorse-man form, holding his bow high in salute. Just your typical summercamp send-off by your typical centaur.\n\n\fArgus drove us out of the countryside and into western Long Island. It felt\nweird to be on a highway again, Annabeth and Grover sitting next to me as if\nwe were normal carpoolers. After two weeks at Half-Blood Hill, the real\nworld seemed like a fantasy. I found myself staring at every McDonald\u2019s,\nevery kid in the back of his parents\u2019 car, every billboard and shopping mall.\n\u201cSo far so good,\u201d I told Annabeth. \u201cTen miles and not a single monster.\u201d\nShe gave me an irritated look. \u201cIt\u2019s bad luck to talk that way, Seaweed\nBrain.\u201d\n\u201cRemind me again\u2014why do you hate me so much?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d\n\u201cCould\u2019ve fooled me.\u201d\nShe folded her cap of invisibility. \u201cLook\u2026we\u2019re just not supposed to get\nalong, okay?

He didn\u2019t say anything, but one blue eye\non the back of his neck winked at me.\nTraffic slowed us down in Queens. By the time we got into Manhattan it\nwas sunset and starting to rain.\nArgus dropped us at the Greyhound Station on the Upper East Side, not\nfar from my mom and Gabe\u2019s apartment. Taped to a mailbox was a soggy\nflyer with my picture on it: HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOY?\nI ripped it down before Annabeth and Grover could notice.\nArgus unloaded our bags, made sure we got our bus tickets, then drove\naway, the eye on the back of his hand opening to watch us as he pulled out of\nthe parking lot.\nI thought about how close I was to my old apartment. On a normal day,\nmy mom would be home from the candy store by now. Smelly Gabe was\nprobably up there right now, playing poker, not even missing her.\nGrover shouldered his backpack. He gazed down the street in the\ndirection I was looking. \u201cYou want to know why she married him, Percy?\u201d\nI stared at him. \u201cWere you reading my mind or something?\u201d\n\u201cJust your emotions.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cGuess I forgot to tell you satyrs can\ndo that. You were thinking about your mom and your stepdad, right?\u201d\nI nodded, wondering what else Grover might\u2019ve forgotten to tell me.\n\u201cYour mom married Gabe for you,\u201d Grover told me. \u201cYou call him\n\u2018Smelly,\u2019 but you\u2019ve got no idea. The guy has this aura\u2026.Yuck. I can smell\nhim from here. I can smell traces of him on you, and you haven\u2019t been near\nhim for a week.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the nearest shower?\u201d\n\u201cYou should be grateful, Percy. Your stepfather smells so repulsively\nhuman he could mask the presence of any demigod. As soon as I took a\n\n\fwhiff inside his Camaro, I knew: Gabe has been covering your scent for\nyears. If you hadn\u2019t lived with him every summer, you probably would\u2019ve\nbeen found by monsters a long time ago. Your mom stayed with him to\nprotect you. She was a smart lady. She must\u2019ve loved you a lot to put up\nwith that guy\u2014if that makes you feel any better.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t, but I forced myself not to show it. I\u2019ll see her again, I thought.\nShe isn\u2019t gone.\nI wondered if Grover could still read my emotions, mixed up as they\nwere. I was glad he and Annabeth were with me, but I felt guilty that I\nhadn\u2019t been straight with them. I hadn\u2019t told them the real reason I\u2019d said yes\nto this crazy quest.\nThe truth was, I didn\u2019t care about retrieving Zeus\u2019s lightning bolt, or\nsaving the world, or even helping my father out of trouble.

Annabeth was unbelievable. She could bounce\nthe apple off her knee, her elbow, her shoulder, whatever. I wasn\u2019t too bad\nmyself.\nThe game ended when I tossed the apple toward Grover and it got too\nclose to his mouth. In one mega goat bite, our Hacky Sack disappeared\u2014\ncore, stem, and all.\nGrover blushed. He tried to apologize, but Annabeth and I were too busy\ncracking up.\nFinally the bus came. As we stood in line to board, Grover started\nlooking around, sniffing the air like he smelled his favorite school cafeteria\ndelicacy\u2014enchiladas.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said tensely. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\fBut I could tell it wasn\u2019t nothing. I started looking over my shoulder, too.\nI was relieved when we finally got on board and found seats together in\nthe back of the bus. We stowed our backpacks. Annabeth kept slapping her\nYankees cap nervously against her thigh.\nAs the last passengers got on, Annabeth clamped her hand onto my knee.\n\u201cPercy.\u201d\nAn old lady had just boarded the bus. She wore a crumpled velvet dress,\nlace gloves, and a shapeless orange-knit hat that shadowed her face, and she\ncarried a big paisley purse. When she tilted her head up, her black eyes\nglittered, and my heart skipped a beat.\nIt was Mrs. Dodds. Older, more withered, but definitely the same evil\nface.\nI scrunched down in my seat.\nBehind her came two more old ladies: one in a green hat, one in a purple\nhat. Otherwise they looked exactly like Mrs. Dodds\u2014same gnarled hands,\npaisley handbags, wrinkled velvet dresses. Triplet demon grandmothers.\nThey sat in the front row, right behind the driver. The two on the aisle\ncrossed their legs over the walkway, making an X. It was casual enough, but\nit sent a clear message: nobody leaves.\nThe bus pulled out of the station, and we headed through the slick streets\nof Manhattan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t stay dead long,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice\nfrom quivering. \u201cI thought you said they could be dispelled for a lifetime.\u201d\n\u201cI said if you\u2019re lucky,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cYou\u2019re obviously not.\u201d\n\u201cAll three of them,\u201d Grover whipered. \u201cDi immortales!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Annabeth said, obviously thinking hard. \u201cThe Furies. The\nthree worst monsters from the Underworld. No problem. No problem. We\u2019ll\njust slip out the windows.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t open,\u201d Grover moaned.\n\u201cA back exit?\u201d she suggested.\nThere wasn\u2019t one. Even if there had been, it wouldn\u2019t have helped.

In a flat voice, as if she\u2019d rehearsed it, she\nannounced to the whole bus: \u201cI need to use the restroom.\u201d\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d said the second sister.\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d said the third sister.\nThey all started down the aisle.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cPercy, take my hat.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one they want.

I managed to get up ten rows, then duck\ninto an empty seat just as the Furies walked past.\nMrs. Dodds stopped, sniffing, and looked straight at me. My heart was\npounding.\nApparently she didn\u2019t see anything. She and her sisters kept going.\nI was free. I made it to the front of the bus. We were almost through the\nLincoln Tunnel now. I was about to press the emergency stop button when I\nheard hideous wailing from the back row.\nThe old ladies were not old ladies anymore. Their faces were still the\nsame\u2014I guess those couldn\u2019t get any uglier\u2014but their bodies had shriveled\ninto leathery brown hag bodies with bat\u2019s wings and hands and feet like\ngargoyle claws. Their handbags had turned into fiery whips.\nThe Furies surrounded Grover and Annabeth, lashing their whips,\nhissing: \u201cWhere is it? Where?\u201d\nThe other people on the bus were screaming, cowering in their seats.\nThey saw something, all right.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not here!\u201d Annabeth yelled. \u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\nThe Furies raised their whips.\n\n\fAnnabeth drew her bronze knife. Grover grabbed a tin can from his\nsnack bag and prepared to throw it.\nWhat I did next was so impulsive and dangerous I should\u2019ve been named\nADHD poster child of the year.\nThe bus driver was distracted, trying to see what was going on in his\nrearview mirror.\nStill invisible, I grabbed the wheel from him and jerked it to the left.\nEverybody howled as they were thrown to the right, and I heard what I\nhoped was the sound of three Furies smashing against the windows.\n\u201cHey!\u201d the driver yelled. \u201cHey\u2014whoa!\u201d\nWe wrestled for the wheel. The bus slammed against the side of the\ntunnel, grinding metal, throwing sparks a mile behind us.\nWe careened out of the Lincoln Tunnel and back into the rainstorm,\npeople and monsters tossed around the bus, cars plowed aside like bowling\npins.\nSomehow the driver found an exit.

Mrs. Dodds stalked up the aisle, just as she\nused to do in class, about to deliver my F- math test.

I stuck the Fury on the left with its hilt, sending her toppling\nbackward into a seat. I turned and sliced the Fury on the right. As soon as the\nblade connected with her neck, she screamed and exploded into dust.\nAnnabeth got Mrs. Dodds in a wrestler\u2019s hold and yanked her backward\nwhile Grover ripped the whip out of her hands.\n\u201cOw!\u201d he yelled. \u201cOw!

She kicked, clawed,\nhissed, and bit, but Annabeth held on while Grover got Mrs. Dodds\u2019s legs\ntied up in her own whip. Finally they both shoved her backward into the\naisle.

For instance, when you\u2019re\nwalking away from a bus that\u2019s just been attacked by monster hags and\nblown up by lightning, and it\u2019s raining on top of everything else, most\npeople might think that\u2019s just really bad luck; when you\u2019re a half-blood, you\nunderstand that some divine force really is trying to mess up your day.\nSo there we were, Annabeth and Grover and I, walking through the\nwoods along the New Jersey riverbank, the glow of New York City making\nthe night sky yellow behind us, and the smell of the Hudson reeking in our\nnoses.\nGrover was shivering and braying, his big goat eyes turned slit-pupiled\nand full of terror. \u201cThree Kindly Ones. All three at once.\u201d\nI was pretty much in shock myself. The explosion of bus windows still\nrang in my ears. But Annabeth kept pulling us along, saying: \u201cCome on! The\nfarther away we get, the better.\u201d\n\u201cAll our money was back there,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cOur food and clothes.\nEverything.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe if you hadn\u2019t decided to jump into the fight\u2014\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhat did you want me to do?

That was really\nbrave.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team, right?\u201d\nShe was silent for a few more steps. \u201cIt\u2019s just that if you died\u2026aside\nfrom the fact that it would really suck for you, it would mean the quest was\nover. This may be my only chance to see the real world.\u201d\nThe thunderstorm had finally let up. The city glow faded behind us,\nleaving us in almost total darkness.

This boy\nneeded a double cheeseburger.\nWe kept walking until I saw a deserted two-lane road through the trees.\nOn the other side was a closed-down gas station, a tattered billboard for a\n1990s movie, and one open business, which was the source of the neon light\nand the good smell.\nIt wasn\u2019t a fast-food restaurant like I\u2019d hoped. It was one of those weird\nroadside curio shops that sell lawn flamingos and wooden Indians and\ncement grizzly bears and stuff like that. The main building was a long, low\nwarehouse, surrounded by acres of statuary. The neon sign above the gate\nwas impossible for me to read, because if there\u2019s anything worse for my\ndyslexia than regular English, it\u2019s red cursive neon English.\nTo me, it looked like: atnyu mes gderan gomen meprouim.\n\u201cWhat the heck does that say?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Annabeth said.\nShe loved reading so much, I\u2019d forgotten she was dyslexic, too.\nGrover translated: \u201cAunty Em\u2019s Garden Gnome Emporium.\u201d\nFlanking the entrance, as advertised, were two cement garden gnomes,\nugly bearded little runts, smiling and waving, as if they were about to get\ntheir picture taken.\nI crossed the street, following the smell of the hamburgers.\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Grover warned.\n\u201cThe lights are on inside,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s open.\u201d\n\u201cSnack bar,\u201d I said wistfully.\n\u201cSnack bar,\u201d she agreed.\n\u201cAre you two crazy?\u201d Grover said. \u201cThis place is weird.\u201d\nWe ignored him.\n\n\fThe front lot was a forest of statues: cement animals, cement children,\neven a cement satyr playing the pipes, which gave Grover the creeps.\n\u201cBlah-ha-ha!\u201d he bleated. \u201cLooks like my Uncle Ferdinand!\u201d\nWe stopped at the warehouse door.\n\u201cDon\u2019t knock,\u201d Grover pleaded. \u201cI smell monsters.\u201d\n\u201cYour nose is clogged up from the Furies,\u201d Annabeth told him. \u201cAll I\nsmell is burgers.

Her eyes glinted behind a curtain of black gauze, but\nthat was about all I could make out. Her coffee-colored hands looked old,\nbut well-manicured and elegant, so I imagined she was a grandmother who\nhad once been a beautiful lady.\n\n\fHer accent sounded vaguely Middle Eastern, too. She said, \u201cChildren, it\nis too late to be out all alone.

The\nringmaster told us to meet him at the gas station if we got lost, but he may\nhave forgotten, or maybe he meant a different gas station. Anyway, we\u2019re\nlost. Is that food I smell?\u201d\n\u201cOh, my dears,\u201d the woman said. \u201cYou must come in, poor children. I am\nAunty Em. Go straight through to the back of the warehouse, please.

I was thinking you\u2019d have to have a pretty huge garden to fit even one\nof these statues, because they were all life-size. But mostly, I was thinking\nabout food.\nGo ahead, call me an idiot for walking into a strange lady\u2019s shop like that\njust because I was hungry, but I do impulsive stuff sometimes. Plus, you\u2019ve\nnever smelled Aunty Em\u2019s burgers. The aroma was like laughing gas in the\ndentist\u2019s chair\u2014it made everything else go away. I barely noticed Grover\u2019s\nnervous whimpers, or the way the statues\u2019 eyes seemed to follow me, or the\nfact that Aunty Em had locked the door behind us.\nAll I cared about was finding the dining area. And sure enough, there it\nwas at the back of the warehouse, a fast-food counter with a grill, a soda\nfountain, a pretzel heater, and a nacho cheese dispenser. Everything you\ncould want, plus a few steel picnic tables out front.\n\u201cPlease, sit down,\u201d Aunty Em said.\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d I said.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Grover said reluctantly, \u201cwe don\u2019t have any money, ma\u2019am.\u201d\nBefore I could jab him in the ribs, Aunty Em said, \u201cNo, no, children.

Annabeth shook her head.\n\u201cHissing?\u201d Aunty Em asked. \u201cPerhaps you hear the deep-fryer oil. You\nhave keen ears, Grover.\u201d\n\u201cI take vitamins. For my ears.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s admirable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut please, relax.\u201d\nAunty Em ate nothing. She hadn\u2019t taken off her headdress, even to cook,\nand now she sat forward and interlaced her fingers and watched us eat. It\nwas a little unsettling, having someone stare at me when I couldn\u2019t see her\nface, but I was feeling satisfied after the burger, and a little sleepy, and I\nfigured the least I could do was try to make small talk with our hostess.\n\u201cSo, you sell gnomes,\u201d I said, trying to sound interested.\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Aunty Em said. \u201cAnd animals. And people. Anything for the\ngarden. Custom orders. Statuary is very popular, you know.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cA lot of business on this road?\u201d\n\u201cNot so much, no. Since the highway was built\u2026most cars, they do not\ngo this way now. I must cherish every customer I get.\u201d\nMy neck tingled, as if somebody else was looking at me. I turned, but it\nwas just a statue of a young girl holding an Easter basket. The detail was\nincredible, much better than you see in most garden statues. But something\nwas wrong with her face. It looked as if she were startled, or even terrified.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Aunty Em said sadly. \u201cYou notice some of my creations do not\nturn out well. They are marred. They do not sell. The face is the hardest to\n\n\fget right. Always the face.\u201d\n\u201cYou make these statues yourself?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOh, yes. Once upon a time, I had two sisters to help me in the business,\nbut they have passed on, and Aunty Em is alone. I have only my statues.\nThis is why I make them, you see. They are my company.\u201d The sadness in\nher voice sounded so deep and so real that I couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for\nher.\nAnnabeth had stopped eating. She sat forward and said, \u201cTwo sisters?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible story,\u201d Aunty Em said. \u201cNot one for children, really. You\nsee, Annabeth, a bad woman was jealous of me, long ago when I was young.\nI had a\u2026a boyfriend, you know, and this bad woman was determined to\nbreak us apart.

It took all my willpower\nnot to look. I could feel warm ooze soaking into my sock, little dying snake\nheads tugging at my shoelaces.\n\u201cOh, yuck,\u201d Grover said. His eyes were still tightly closed, but I guess he\ncould hear the thing gurgling and streaming. \u201cMega-yuck.\u201d\nAnnabeth came up next to me, her eyes fixed on the sky. She was\nholding Medusa\u2019s black veil. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\nVery, very carefully, without looking down, she knelt and draped the\nmonster\u2019s head in black cloth, then picked it up. It was still dripping green\njuice.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked me, her voice trembling.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I decided, though I felt like throwing up my double\ncheeseburger. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t\u2026why didn\u2019t the head evaporate?\u201d\n\u201cOnce you sever it, it becomes a spoil of war,\u201d she said. \u201cSame as your\nminotaur horn. But don\u2019t unwrap the head. It can still petrify you.\u201d\nGrover moaned as he climbed down from the grizzly statue. He had a big\nwelt on his forehead. His green rasta cap hung from one of his little goat\nhorns, and his fake feet had been knocked off his hooves. The magic\nsneakers were flying aimlessly around his head.\n\u201cThe Red Baron,\u201d I said. \u201cGood job, man.\u201d\nHe managed a bashful grin. \u201cThat really was not fun, though. Well, the\nhitting-her-with-a-stick part, that was fun. But crashing into a concrete bear?\nNot fun.\u201d\nHe snatched his shoes out of the air. I recapped my sword. Together, the\nthree of us stumbled back to the warehouse.\nWe found some old plastic grocery bags behind the snack counter and\ndouble-wrapped Medusa\u2019s head. We plopped it on the table where we\u2019d\neaten dinner and sat around it, too exhausted to speak.\nFinally I said, \u201cSo we have Athena to thank for this monster?\u201d\nAnnabeth flashed me an irritated look. \u201cYour dad, actually. Don\u2019t you\nremember? Medusa was Poseidon\u2019s girlfriend. They decided to meet in my\nmother\u2019s temple. That\u2019s why Athena turned her into a monster. Medusa and\nher two sisters who had helped her get into the temple, they became the three\ngorgons. That\u2019s why Medusa wanted to slice me up, but she wanted to\n\n\fpreserve you as a nice statue. She\u2019s still sweet on your dad. You probably\nreminded her of him.\u201d\nMy face was burning. \u201cOh, so now it\u2019s my fault we met Medusa.\u201d\nAnnabeth straightened. In a bad imitation of my voice, she said: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s\njust a photo, Annabeth.

You would be better off as\na statue.\nI got up. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\u201cPercy,\u201d Annabeth called after me. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nI searched the back of the warehouse until I found Medusa\u2019s office. Her\naccount book showed her six most recent sales, all shipments to the\nUnderworld to decorate Hades and Persephone\u2019s garden. According to one\nfreight bill, the Underworld\u2019s billing address was DOA Recording Studios,\nWest Hollywood, California. I folded up the bill and stuffed it in my pocket.\nIn the cash register I found twenty dollars, a few golden drachmas, and\nsome packing slips for Hermes Overnight Express, each with a little leather\nbag attached for coins. I rummaged around the rest of the office until I found\nthe right-size box.\nI went back to the picnic table, packed up Medusa\u2019s head, and filled out a\ndelivery slip:\nThe Gods\nMount Olympus\n600th Floor,\nEmpire State Building\n\n\fNew York, NY\nWith best wishes,\nPERCY JACKSON\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to like that,\u201d Grover warned. \u201cThey\u2019ll think you\u2019re\nimpertinent.\u201d\nI poured some golden drachmas in the pouch. As soon as I closed it,\nthere was a sound like a cash register. The package floated off the table and\ndisappeared with a pop!\n\n\u201cI am impertinent,\u201d I said.\nI looked at Annabeth, daring her to criticize.\nShe didn\u2019t. She seemed resigned to the fact that I had a major talent for\nticking off the gods. \u201cCome on,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWe need a new plan.\u201d\n\n\fW\n\nE WERE PRETTY MISERABLE THAT night.\n\nWe camped out in the woods, a hundred yards from the main road, in a\nmarshy clearing that local kids had obviously been using for parties. The\nground was littered with flattened soda cans and fast-food wrappers.\nWe\u2019d taken some food and blankets from Aunty Em\u2019s, but we didn\u2019t dare\nlight a fire to dry our damp clothes. The Furies and Medusa had provided\nenough excitement for one day. We didn\u2019t want to attract anything else.\nWe decided to sleep in shifts. I volunteered to take first watch.\nAnnabeth curled up on the blankets and was snoring as soon as her head\nhit the ground. Grover fluttered with his flying shoes to the lowest bough of\na tree, put his back to the trunk, and stared at the night sky.\n\u201cGo ahead and sleep,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019ll wake you if there\u2019s trouble.\u201d\nHe nodded, but still didn\u2019t close his eyes. \u201cIt makes me sad, Percy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does? The fact that you signed up for this stupid quest?\u201d\n\u201cNo. This makes me sad.\u201d He pointed at all the garbage on the ground.\n\u201cAnd the sky. You can\u2019t even see the stars. They\u2019ve polluted the sky. This is\na terrible time to be a satyr.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah.

The great god Pan! What do you\nthink I want a searcher\u2019s license for?\u201d\nA strange breeze rustled through the clearing, temporarily overpowering\nthe stink of trash and muck. It brought the smell of berries and wildflowers\nand clean rainwater, things that might\u2019ve once been in these woods.\nSuddenly I was nostalgic for something I\u2019d never known.\n\u201cTell me about the search,\u201d I said.\n\n\f\fGrover looked at me cautiously, as if he were afraid I was just making\nfun.\n\u201cThe God of Wild Places disappeared two thousand years ago,\u201d he told\nme. \u201cA sailor off the coast of Ephesos heard a mysterious voice crying out\nfrom the shore, \u2018Tell them that the great god Pan has died!\u2019 When humans\nheard the news, they believed it. They\u2019ve been pillaging Pan\u2019s kingdoms\never since. But for the satyrs, Pan was our lord and master. He protected us\nand the wild places of the earth. We refuse to believe that he died. In every\ngeneration, the bravest satyrs pledge their lives to finding Pan. They search\nthe earth, exploring all the wildest places, hoping to find where he is hidden,\nand wake him from his sleep.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you want to be a searcher.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my life\u2019s dream,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father was a searcher. And my Uncle\nFerdinand\u2026the statue you saw back there\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, right, sorry.\u201d\nGrover shook his head. \u201cUncle Ferdinand knew the risks. So did my dad.\nBut I\u2019ll succeed. I\u2019ll be the first searcher to return alive.\u201d\n\u201cHang on\u2014the first?\u201d\nGrover took his reed pipes out of his pocket. \u201cNo searcher has ever come\nback. Once they set out, they disappear. They\u2019re never seen alive again.\u201d\n\u201cNot once in two thousand years?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your dad? You have no idea what happened to him?\u201d\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\u201cBut you still want to go,\u201d I said, amazed. \u201cI mean, you really think\nyou\u2019ll be the one to find Pan?\u201d\n\u201cI have to believe that, Percy. Every searcher does. It\u2019s the only thing\nthat keeps us from despair when we look at what humans have done to the\nworld. I have to believe Pan can still be awakened.\u201d\nI stared at the orange haze of the sky and tried to understand how Grover\ncould pursue a dream that seemed so hopeless. Then again, was I any better?\n\u201cHow are we going to get into the Underworld?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI mean,\nwhat chance do we have against a god?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut back at Medusa\u2019s, when you were\nsearching her office? Annabeth was telling me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, I forgot. Annabeth will have a plan all figured out.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on her, Percy.

That\u2019s why you mailed Medusa\u2019s\nhead to Olympus. You wanted him to notice what you\u2019d done.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well, maybe satyr emotions work differently than human\nemotions. Because you\u2019re wrong. I don\u2019t care what he thinks.\u201d\nGrover pulled his feet up onto the branch. \u201cOkay, Percy. Whatever.\u201d\n\u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t done anything worth bragging about.

According\nto Gladiola, the westbound train leaves at noon.\u201d\n\n\fW\n\nE SPENT TWO DAYS ON THE Amtrak train, heading west through hills, over\n\nrivers, past amber waves of grain.\nWe weren\u2019t attacked once, but I didn\u2019t relax. I felt that we were traveling\naround in a display case, being watched from above and maybe from below,\nthat something was waiting for the right opportunity.\nI tried to keep a low profile because my name and picture were splattered\nover the front pages of several East Coast newspapers. The Trenton RegisterNews showed a photo taken by a tourist as I got off the Greyhound bus. I had\na wild look in my eyes. My sword was a metallic blur in my hands. It\nmight\u2019ve been a baseball bat or a lacrosse stick.\nThe picture\u2019s caption read:\nTwelve-year-old Percy Jackson, wanted for questioning in the Long\nIsland disappearance of his mother two weeks ago, is shown here\nfleeing from the bus where he accosted several elderly female\npassengers. The bus exploded on an east New Jersey roadside shortly\nafter Jackson fled the scene. Based on eyewitness accounts, police\nbelieve the boy may be traveling with two teenage accomplices. His\nstepfather, Gabe Ugliano, has offered a cash reward for information\nleading to his capture.\n\n\f\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Annabeth told me. \u201cMortal police could never find us.\u201d\nBut she didn\u2019t sound so sure.\nThe rest of the day I spent alternately pacing the length of the train\n(because I had a really hard time sitting still) or looking out the windows.\nOnce, I spotted a family of centaurs galloping across a wheat field, bows\nat the ready, as they hunted lunch. The little boy centaur, who was the size of\na second-grader on a pony, caught my eye and waved. I looked around the\npassenger car, but nobody else had noticed. The adult riders all had their\nfaces buried in laptop computers or magazines.\nAnother time, toward evening, I saw something huge moving through the\nwoods. I could\u2019ve sworn it was a lion, except that lions don\u2019t live wild in\nAmerica, and this thing was the size of a Hummer. Its fur glinted gold in the\nevening light. Then it leaped through the trees and was gone.\nOur reward money for returning Gladiola the poodle had only been enough\nto purchase tickets as far as Denver. We couldn\u2019t get berths in the sleeper car,\nso we dozed in our seats. My neck got stiff. I tried not to drool in my sleep,\nsince Annabeth was sitting right next to me.\nGrover kept snoring and bleating and waking me up. Once, he shuffled\naround and his fake foot fell off. Annabeth and I had to stick it back on\nbefore any of the other passengers noticed.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Annabeth asked me, once we\u2019d gotten Grover\u2019s sneaker\nreadjusted. \u201cWho wants your help?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you were asleep just now, you mumbled, \u2018I won\u2019t help you.\u2019 Who\nwere you dreaming about?\u201d\nI was reluctant to say anything.

Once, he shuffled\naround and his fake foot fell off. Annabeth and I had to stick it back on\nbefore any of the other passengers noticed.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Annabeth asked me, once we\u2019d gotten Grover\u2019s sneaker\nreadjusted. \u201cWho wants your help?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you were asleep just now, you mumbled, \u2018I won\u2019t help you.\u2019 Who\nwere you dreaming about?\u201d\nI was reluctant to say anything. It was the second time I\u2019d dreamed about\nthe evil voice from the pit. But it bothered me so much I finally told her.\nAnnabeth was quiet for a long time. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like Hades. He\nalways appears on a black throne, and he never laughs.\u201d\n\u201cHe offered my mother in trade. Who else could do that?\u201d\n\u201cI guess\u2026if he meant, \u2018Help me rise from the Underworld.\u2019 If he wants\nwar with the Olympians. But why ask you to bring him the master bolt if he\nalready has it?\u201d\nI shook my head, wishing I knew the answer. I thought about what\nGrover had told me, that the Furies on the bus seemed to have been looking\nfor something.\n\n\fWhere is it? Where?\nMaybe Grover sensed my emotions. He snorted in his sleep, muttered\nsomething about vegetables, and turned his head.\nAnnabeth readjusted his cap so it covered his horns. \u201cPercy, you can\u2019t\nbarter with Hades. You know that, right? He\u2019s deceitful, heartless, and\ngreedy. I don\u2019t care if his Kindly Ones weren\u2019t as aggressive this time\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThis time?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ve run into them before?\u201d\nHer hand crept up to her necklace. She fingered a glazed white bead\npainted with the image of a pine tree, one of her clay end-of-summer tokens.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve got no love for the Lord of the Dead. You can\u2019t be\ntempted to make a deal for your mom.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you do if it was your dad?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d leave him to rot.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not serious?\u201d\nAnnabeth\u2019s gray eyes fixed on me. She wore the same expression she\u2019d\nworn in the woods at camp, the moment she drew her sword against the\nhellhound. \u201cMy dad\u2019s resented me since the day I was born, Percy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHe never wanted a baby. When he got me, he asked Athena to take me back\nand raise me on Olympus because he was too busy with his work. She\nwasn\u2019t happy about that. She told him heroes had to be raised by their mortal\nparent.\u201d\n\u201cBut how\u2026I mean, I guess you weren\u2019t born in a hospital\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI appeared on my father\u2019s doorstep, in a golden cradle, carried down\nfrom Olympus by Zephyr the West Wind. You\u2019d think my dad would\nremember that as a miracle, right? Like, maybe he\u2019d take some digital\nphotos or something. But he always talked about my arrival as if it were the\nmost inconvenient thing that had ever happened to him. When I was five he\ngot married and totally forgot about Athena. He got a \u2018regular\u2019 mortal wife,\nand had two \u2018regular\u2019 mortal kids, and tried to pretend I didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nI stared out the train window. The lights of a sleeping town were drifting\nby. I wanted to make Annabeth feel better, but I didn\u2019t know how.\n\u201cMy mom married a really awful guy,\u201d I told her. \u201cGrover said she did it\nto protect me, to hide me in the scent of a human family. Maybe that\u2019s what\nyour dad was thinking.\u201d\nAnnabeth kept worrying at her necklace. She was pinching the gold\ncollege ring that hung with the beads. It occurred to me that the ring must be\nher father\u2019s.

I made\na couple of unexpected friends who took care of me, for a short time,\nanyway.\u201d\nI wanted to ask what happened, but Annabeth seemed lost in sad\nmemories. So I listened to the sound of Grover snoring and gazed out the\ntrain windows as the dark fields of Ohio raced by.\nToward the end of our second day on the train, June 13, eight days before the\nsummer solstice, we passed through some golden hills and over the\nMississippi River into St. Louis.\nAnnabeth craned her neck to see the Gateway Arch, which looked to me\nlike a huge shopping bag handle stuck on the city.\n\u201cI want to do that,\u201d she sighed.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cBuild something like that. You ever see the Parthenon, Percy?\u201d\n\u201cOnly in pictures.\u201d\n\u201cSomeday, I\u2019m going to see it in person. I\u2019m going to build the greatest\nmonument to the gods, ever. Something that\u2019ll last a thousand years.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cYou? An architect?\u201d\nI don\u2019t know why, but I found it funny. Just the idea of Annabeth trying\nto sit quietly and draw all day.\nHer cheeks flushed. \u201cYes, an architect. Athena expects her children to\ncreate things, not just tear them down, like a certain god of earthquakes I\ncould mention.\u201d\nI watched the churning brown water of the Mississippi below.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cThat was mean.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cCan\u2019t we work together a little?\u201d I pleaded. \u201cI mean, didn\u2019t Athena and\nPoseidon ever cooperate?\u201d\nAnnabeth had to think about it. \u201cI guess\u2026the chariot,\u201d she said\ntentatively. \u201cMy mom invented it, but Poseidon created horses out of the\ncrests of waves. So they had to work together to make it complete.\u201d\n\u201cThen we can cooperate, too. Right?\u201d\nWe rode into the city, Annabeth watching as the Arch disappeared behind\na hotel.\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d she said at last.\nWe pulled into the Amtrak station downtown. The intercom told us we\u2019d\nhave a three-hour layover before departing for Denver.\nGrover stretched. Before he was even fully awake, he said, \u201cFood.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, goat boy,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cSightseeing.\u201d\n\u201cSightseeing?\u201d\n\u201cThe Gateway Arch,\u201d she said. \u201cThis may be my only chance to ride to\nthe top. Are you coming or not?\u201d\nGrover and I exchanged looks.\nI wanted to say no, but I figured that if Annabeth was going, we couldn\u2019t\nvery well let her go alone.\nGrover shrugged. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s a snack bar without monsters.\u201d\nThe Arch was about a mile from the train station. Late in the day, the lines to\nget in weren\u2019t that long. We threaded our way through the underground\nmuseum, looking at covered wagons and other junk from the 1800s. It\nwasn\u2019t all that thrilling, but Annabeth kept telling us interesting facts about\nhow the Arch was built, and Grover kept passing me jelly beans, so I was\nokay.\nI kept looking around, though, at the other people in line. \u201cYou smell\nanything?\u201d I murmured to Grover.\nHe took his nose out of the jelly-bean bag long enough to sniff.\n\u201cUnderground,\u201d he said distastefully.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 256871, "end_char_idx": 260676, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf87c6f6-5aa4-414d-b5ef-9b05aacd7598": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf87c6f6-5aa4-414d-b5ef-9b05aacd7598", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f762250-1558-48aa-aaa3-8d57617002d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "05de6e8bd9674ae618dd01b932d63277c5a45f0184097e6bad38be9db9dcb6f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a9f975f-603c-41c7-ac10-7ee05ddd7a65", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0a0c4b1772b387f2f6623aff5fa765de52435d3f2651b941e927f043e4429ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I wanted to say no, but I figured that if Annabeth was going, we couldn\u2019t\nvery well let her go alone.\nGrover shrugged. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s a snack bar without monsters.\u201d\nThe Arch was about a mile from the train station.

Doesn\u2019t he have a hat\nlike Annabeth\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the Helm of Darkness,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s his\nsymbol of power. I saw it next to his seat during the winter solstice council\nmeeting.\u201d\n\u201cHe was there?\u201d I asked.\nShe nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time he\u2019s allowed to visit Olympus\u2014the\ndarkest day of the year. But his helm is a lot more powerful than my\ninvisibility hat, if what I\u2019ve heard is true\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt allows him to become darkness,\u201d Grover confirmed. \u201cHe can melt\ninto shadow or pass through walls. He can\u2019t be touched, or seen, or heard.\nAnd he can radiate fear so intense it can drive you insane or stop your heart.\nWhy do you think all rational creatures fear the dark?\u201d\n\u201cBut then\u2026how do we know he\u2019s not here right now, watching us?\u201d I\nasked.\nAnnabeth and Grover exchanged looks.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d Grover said.\n\u201cThanks, that makes me feel a lot better,\u201d I said. \u201cGot any blue jelly\nbeans left?\u201d\nI\u2019d almost mastered my jumpy nerves when I saw the tiny little elevator\ncar we were going to ride to the top of the Arch, and I knew I was in trouble.\nI hate confined places. They make me nuts.\nWe got shoehorned into the car with this big fat lady and her dog, a\nChihuahua with a rhinestone collar. I figured maybe the dog was a seeingeye Chihuahua, because none of the guards said a word about it.\nWe started going up, inside the Arch. I\u2019d never been in an elevator that\nwent in a curve, and my stomach wasn\u2019t too happy about it.\n\u201cNo parents?\u201d the fat lady asked us.\nShe had beady eyes; pointy, coffee-stained teeth; a floppy denim hat, and\na denim dress that bulged so much, she looked like a blue-jean blimp.\n\u201cThey\u2019re below,\u201d Annabeth told her. \u201cScared of heights.\u201d\n\u201cOh, the poor darlings.\u201d\nThe Chihuahua growled. The woman said, \u201cNow, now, sonny. Behave.\u201d\nThe dog had beady eyes like its owner, intelligent and vicious.\nI said, \u201cSonny. Is that his name?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNo,\u201d the lady told me.\nShe smiled, as if that cleared everything up.\nAt the top of the Arch, the observation deck reminded me of a tin can\nwith carpeting. Rows of tiny windows looked out over the city on one side\nand the river on the other.

She smiled back, her forked tongue\nflickering between her teeth.\nWait a minute.\nForked tongue?\nBefore I could decide if I\u2019d really seen that, her Chihuahua jumped down\nand started yapping at me.\n\u201cNow, now, sonny,\u201d the lady said. \u201cDoes this look like a good time?

The\npupils of her eyes were sideways slits, like a reptile\u2019s.\nThe Chihuahua barked louder, and with each bark, it grew. First to the\nsize of a Doberman, then to a lion. The bark became a roar.\nThe little boy screamed. His parents pulled him back toward the exit,\nstraight into the park ranger, who stood, paralyzed, gaping at the monster.\nThe Chimera was now so tall its back rubbed against the roof. It had the\nhead of a lion with a blood-caked mane, the body and hooves of a giant goat,\nand a serpent for a tail, a ten-foot-long diamondback growing right out of its\nshaggy behind. The rhinestone dog collar still hung around its neck, and the\nplate-sized dog tag was now easy to read: CHIMERA\u2014RABID, FIRE-BREATHING,\nPOISONOUS\u2014IF FOUND, PLEASE CALL TARTARUS\u2014EXT. 954.\n\nI realized I hadn\u2019t even uncapped my sword.

I tried to regain my balance, but I was so worried about defending\nmyself against the fiery lion\u2019s mouth, I completely forgot about the serpent\ntail until it whipped around and sank its fangs into my calf.\nMy whole leg was on fire. I tried to jab Riptide into the Chimera\u2019s\nmouth, but the serpent tail wrapped around my ankles and pulled me off\nbalance, and my blade flew out of my hand, spinning out of the hole in the\nArch and down toward the Mississippi River.\nI managed to get to my feet, but I knew I had lost. I was weaponless. I\ncould feel deadly poison racing up to my chest. I remembered Chiron saying\nthat Anaklusmos would always return to me, but there was no pen in my\npocket. Maybe it had fallen too far away. Maybe it only returned when it was\nin pen form. I didn\u2019t know, and I wasn\u2019t going to live long enough to figure\nit out.\nI backed into the hole in the wall. The Chimera advanced, growling,\nsmoke curling from its lips. The snake lady, Echidna, cackled. \u201cThey don\u2019t\nmake heroes like they used to, eh, son?\u201d\nThe monster growled. It seemed in no hurry to finish me off now that I\nwas beaten.\n\n\fI glanced at the park ranger and the family. The little boy was hiding\nbehind his father\u2019s legs.

Steeples and skyscrapers and bridges tumbled in and out of\nmy vision.\nAnd then: Flaaa-booom!\nA whiteout of bubbles.

A catfish the size of my stepfather lurched away into the gloom.\nClouds of silt and disgusting garbage\u2014beer bottles, old shoes, plastic bags\n\u2014swirled up all around me.\nAt that point, I realized a few things: first, I had not been flattened into a\npancake. I had not been barbecued. I couldn\u2019t even feel the Chimera poison\nboiling in my veins anymore. I was alive, which was good.\n\n\fSecond realization: I wasn\u2019t wet.

Her words seemed to come from everywhere, rippling through\nthe water like dolphin sonar.\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I called aloud.\nThen, through the gloom, I saw her\u2014a woman the color of the water, a\nghost in the current, floating just above the sword. She had long billowing\n\n\fhair, and her eyes, barely visible, were green like mine.\nA lump formed in my throat. I said, \u201cMom?\u201d\nNo, child, only a messenger, though your mother\u2019s fate is not as hopeless\nas you believe. Go to the beach in Santa Monica.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nIt is your father\u2019s will. Before you descend into the Underworld, you\nmust go to Santa Monica. Please, Percy, I cannot stay long. The river here is\ntoo foul for my presence.\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d I was sure this woman was my mother, or a vision of her,\nanyway. \u201cWho\u2014how did you\u2014\u201d\nThere was so much I wanted to ask, the words jammed up my throat.\nI cannot stay, brave one, the woman said. She reached out, and I felt the\ncurrent brush my face like a caress. You must go to Santa Monica! And,\nPercy, do not trust the gifts\u2026.\nHer voice faded.\n\u201cGifts?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat gifts? Wait!\u201d\nShe made one more attempt to speak, but the sound was gone. Her image\nmelted away. If it was my mother, I had lost her again.\nI felt like drowning myself. The only problem: I was immune to\ndrowning.\nYour father believes in you, she had said.\nShe\u2019d also called me brave\u2026unless she was talking to the catfish.\nI waded toward Riptide and grabbed it by the hilt. The Chimera might\nstill be up there with its snaky, fat mother, waiting to finish me off. At the\nvery least, the mortal police would be arriving, trying to figure out who had\nblown a hole in the Arch. If they found me, they\u2019d have some questions.\nI capped my sword, stuck the ballpoint pen in my pocket. \u201cThank you,\nFather,\u201d I said again to the dark water.\nThen I kicked up through the muck and swam for the surface.\n\n\f\fI came ashore next to a floating McDonald\u2019s.\nA block away, every emergency vehicle in St. Louis was surrounding the\nArch.

I recognized her\n\n\fimmediately as the mother of the little boy who\u2019d been on the observation\ndeck. She was saying, \u201cAnd then this huge dog, this huge fire-breathing\nChihuahua\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOkay, ma\u2019am,\u201d the paramedic said. \u201cJust calm down. Your family is\nfine.

The train\ntrundled west as darkness fell, police lights still pulsing against the St. Louis\nskyline behind us.\n\n\fT\n\nHE NEXT AFTERNOON, JUNE 14, seven days before the solstice, our train\n\nrolled into Denver. We hadn\u2019t eaten since the night before in the dining car,\nsomewhere in Kansas. We hadn\u2019t taken a shower since Half-Blood Hill, and\nI was sure that was obvious.\n\u201cLet\u2019s try to contact Chiron,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cI want to tell him about\nyour talk with the river spirit.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t use phones, right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about phones.\u201d\nWe wandered through downtown for about half an hour, though I wasn\u2019t\nsure what Annabeth was looking for. The air was dry and hot, which felt\nweird after the humidity of St. Louis. Everywhere we turned, the Rocky\nMountains seemed to be staring at me, like a tidal wave about to crash into\nthe city.\nFinally we found an empty do-it-yourself car wash. We veered toward\nthe stall farthest from the street, keeping our eyes open for patrol cars. We\nwere three adolescents hanging out at a car wash without a car; any cop\nworth his doughnuts would figure we were up to no good.\n\u201cWhat exactly are we doing?\u201d I asked, as Grover took out the spray gun.\n\n\f\u201cIt\u2019s seventy-five cents,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve only got two quarters left.\nAnnabeth?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dining car wiped me out.\u201d\nI fished out my last bit of change and passed Grover a quarter, which left\nme two nickels and one drachma from Medusa\u2019s place.\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Grover said. \u201cWe could do it with a spray bottle, of course,\nbut the connection isn\u2019t as good, and my arm gets tired of pumping.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nHe fed in the quarters and set the knob to FINE MIST. \u201cI-M\u2019ing.\u201d\n\u201cInstant messaging?\u201d\n\u201cIris-messaging,\u201d Annabeth corrected. \u201cThe rainbow goddess Iris carries\nmessages for the gods. If you know how to ask, and she\u2019s not too busy, she\u2019ll\ndo the same for half-bloods.\u201d\n\u201cYou summon the goddess with a spray gun?\u201d\nGrover pointed the nozzle in the air and water hissed out in a thick white\nmist. \u201cUnless you know an easier way to make a rainbow.\u201d\nSure enough, late afternoon light filtered through the vapor and broke\ninto colors.\n\n\f\fAnnabeth held her palm out to me. \u201cDrachma, please.\u201d\nI handed it over.\nShe raised the coin over her head. \u201cO goddess, accept our offering.\u201d\nShe threw the drachma into the rainbow. It disappeared in a golden\nshimmer.\n\u201cHalf-Blood Hill,\u201d Annabeth requested.\nFor a moment, nothing happened.\nThen I was looking through the mist at strawberry fields, and the Long\nIsland Sound in the distance. We seemed to be on the porch of the Big\nHouse. Standing with his back to us at the railing was a sandy-haired guy in\nshorts and an orange tank top. He was holding a bronze sword and seemed to\nbe staring intently at something down in the meadow.\n\u201cLuke!\u201d I called.\nHe turned, eyes wide. I could swear he was standing three feet in front of\nme through a screen of mist, except I could only see the part of him that\nappeared in the rainbow.\n\u201cPercy!\u201d His scarred face broke into a grin. \u201cIs that Annabeth, too?\nThank the gods!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 278135, "end_char_idx": 282018, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "553b31bf-dfdf-4519-a0ad-9f7094493684": {"__data__": {"id_": "553b31bf-dfdf-4519-a0ad-9f7094493684", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "76f304fa-d5ea-444b-b820-401d468d825a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "610201fbf6a170c8bb57677bf417edea54ea16318b36b4f84ecdf000e31a67d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "74f62769-2823-4078-8a79-12d961563747", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "41645ed3281e7c59350e085c0f874636d9773743234986529fc58991ac48b679", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It disappeared in a golden\nshimmer.\n\u201cHalf-Blood Hill,\u201d Annabeth requested.\nFor a moment, nothing happened.\nThen I was looking through the mist at strawberry fields, and the Long\nIsland Sound in the distance.

He held the nozzle out to one side and\nstepped into Luke\u2019s line of vision. \u201cWhat kind of issues?\u201d\nJust then a big Lincoln Continental pulled into the car wash with its\nstereo turned to maximum hip-hop. As the car slid into the next stall, the\nbass from the subwoofers vibrated so much, it shook the pavement.\n\u201cChiron had to\u2014what\u2019s that noise?\u201d Luke yelled.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it!\u201d Annabeth yelled back, looking very relieved to have\nan excuse to get out of sight. \u201cGrover, come on!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Grover said. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGive Percy the nozzle and come on!\u201d she ordered.\nGrover muttered something about girls being harder to understand than\nthe Oracle at Delphi, then he handed me the spray gun and followed\nAnnabeth.\n\n\fI readjusted the hose so I could keep the rainbow going and still see\nLuke.\n\u201cChiron had to break up a fight,\u201d Luke shouted to me over the music.\n\u201cThings are pretty tense here, Percy. Word leaked out about the Zeus\u2013\nPoseidon standoff. We\u2019re still not sure how\u2014probably the same scumbag\nwho summoned the hellhound. Now the campers are starting to take sides.\nIt\u2019s shaping up like the Trojan War all over again. Aphrodite, Ares, and\nApollo are backing Poseidon, more or less. Athena is backing Zeus.\u201d\nI shuddered to think that Clarisse\u2019s cabin would ever be on my dad\u2019s side\nfor anything. In the next stall, I heard Annabeth and some guy arguing with\neach other, then the music\u2019s volume decreased drastically.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s your status?\u201d Luke asked me. \u201cChiron will be sorry he\nmissed you.\u201d\nI told him pretty much everything, including my dreams. It felt so good\nto see him, to feel like I was back at camp even for a few minutes, that I\ndidn\u2019t realize how long I had talked until the beeper went off on the spray\nmachine, and I realized I only had one more minute before the water shut\noff.\n\u201cI wish I could be there,\u201d Luke told me. \u201cWe can\u2019t help much from here,\nI\u2019m afraid, but listen\u2026it had to be Hades who took the master bolt. He was\nthere at Olympus at the winter solstice. I was chaperoning a field trip and we\nsaw him.\u201d\n\u201cBut Chiron said the gods can\u2019t take each other\u2019s magic items directly.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Luke said, looking troubled. \u201cStill\u2026Hades has the helm of\ndarkness. How could anybody else sneak into the throne room and steal the\nmaster bolt? You\u2019d have to be invisible.\u201d\nWe were both silent, until Luke seemed to realize what he\u2019d said.\n\u201cOh, hey,\u201d he protested. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean Annabeth.

She raised her eyebrow skeptically.\n\u201cWell?\u201d\nI said, \u201cWe, um, want to order dinner.\u201d\n\u201cYou kids have money to pay for it?\u201d\nGrover\u2019s lower lip quivered. I was afraid he would start bleating, or\nworse, start eating the linoleum. Annabeth looked ready to pass out from\nhunger.\nI was trying to think up a sob story for the waitress when a rumble shook\nthe whole building; a motorcycle the size of a baby elephant had pulled up to\nthe curb.\nAll conversation in the diner stopped. The motorcycle\u2019s headlight glared\nred. Its gas tank had flames painted on it, and a shotgun holster riveted to\neither side, complete with shotguns. The seat was leather\u2014but leather that\nlooked like\u2026well, Caucasian human skin.\nThe guy on the bike would\u2019ve made pro wrestlers run for Mama. He was\ndressed in a red muscle shirt and black jeans and a black leather duster, with\na hunting knife strapped to his thigh. He wore red wraparound shades, and\nhe had the cruelest, most brutal face I\u2019d ever seen\u2014handsome, I guess, but\nwicked\u2014with an oily black crew cut and cheeks that were scarred from\nmany, many fights. The weird thing was, I felt like I\u2019d seen his face\nsomewhere before.\nAs he walked into the diner, a hot, dry wind blew through the place. All\nthe people rose, as if they were hypnotized, but the biker waved his hand\n\n\fdismissively and they all sat down again. Everybody went back to their\nconversations. The waitress blinked, as if somebody had just pressed the\nrewind button on her brain. She asked us again, \u201cYou kids have money to\npay for it?\u201d\nThe biker said, \u201cIt\u2019s on me.\u201d He slid into our booth, which was way too\nsmall for him, and crowded Annabeth against the window.\nHe looked up at the waitress, who was gaping at him, and said, \u201cAre you\nstill here?\u201d\nHe pointed at her, and she stiffened. She turned as if she\u2019d been spun\naround, then marched back toward the kitchen.\nThe biker looked at me.

Framing somebody to start a war. Oldest trick in the book. I\nrecognized it immediately.

The water park is a mile west on\nDelancy. You can\u2019t miss it.

I\u2019ll meet you back here when\nyou\u2019re done. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d\nAfter that I must have fainted, or fallen into a trance, because when I\nopened my eyes again, Ares was gone. I might\u2019ve thought the conversation\nhad been a dream, but Annabeth\u2019s and Grover\u2019s expressions told me\notherwise.\n\u201cNot good,\u201d Grover said. \u201cAres sought you out, Percy. This is not good.\u201d\nI stared out the window. The motorcycle had disappeared.\nDid Ares really know something about my mom, or was he just playing\nwith me? Now that he was gone, all the anger had drained out of me. I\nrealized Ares must love to mess with people\u2019s emotions. That was his power\n\u2014cranking up the passions so badly, they clouded your ability to think.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably some kind of trick,\u201d I said. \u201cForget Ares. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cLook, I hate Ares as much as anybody, but\nyou don\u2019t ignore the gods unless you want serious bad fortune. He wasn\u2019t\nkidding about turning you into a rodent.\u201d\nI looked down at my cheeseburger, which suddenly didn\u2019t seem so\nappetizing. \u201cWhy does he need us?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a problem that requires brains,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cAres has\nstrength.

Judging from the sign, it once had been called WATERLAND, but now\nsome of the letters were smashed out, so it read WAT R A D.\nThe main gate was padlocked and topped with barbed wire. Inside, huge\ndry waterslides and tubes and pipes curled everywhere, leading to empty\npools. Old tickets and advertisements fluttered around the asphalt. With\nnight coming on, the place looked sad and creepy.\n\u201cIf Ares brings his girlfriend here for a date,\u201d I said, staring up at the\nbarbed wire, \u201cI\u2019d hate to see what she looks like.\u201d\n\u201cPercy,\u201d Annabeth warned. \u201cBe more respectful.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I thought you hated Ares.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s still a god. And his girlfriend is very temperamental.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to insult her looks,\u201d Grover added.\n\u201cWho is she? Echidna?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Aphrodite,\u201d Grover said, a little dreamily. \u201cGoddess of love.\u201d\n\u201cI thought she was married to somebody,\u201d I said. \u201cHephaestus.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh.\u201d I suddenly felt the need to change the subject. \u201cSo how do we get\nin?\u201d\n\u201cMaia!\u201d Grover\u2019s shoes sprouted wings.\nHe flew over the fence, did an unintended somersault in midair, then\nstumbled to a landing on the opposite side. He dusted off his jeans, as if he\u2019d\nplanned the whole thing. \u201cYou guys coming?\u201d\nAnnabeth and I had to climb the old-fashioned way, holding down the\nbarbed wire for each other as we crawled over the top.\nThe shadows grew long as we walked through the park, checking out the\nattractions. There was Ankle Biter Island, Head Over Wedgie, and Dude,\nWhere\u2019s My Swimsuit?\nNo monsters came to get us. Nothing made the slightest noise.\n\n\fWe found a souvenir shop that had been left open. Merchandise still\nlined the shelves: snow globes, pencils, postcards, and racks of\u2014\n\u201cClothes,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cFresh clothes.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWatch me.\u201d\nShe snatched an entire row of stuff off the racks and disappeared into the\nchanging room. A few minutes later she came out in Waterland flower-print\nshorts, a big red Waterland T-shirt, and commemorative Waterland surf\nshoes. A Waterland backpack was slung over her shoulder, obviously stuffed\nwith more goodies.\n\u201cWhat the heck.\u201d Grover shrugged. Soon, all three of us were decked out\nlike walking advertisements for the defunct theme park.\nWe continued searching for the Tunnel of Love. I got the feeling that the\nwhole park was holding its breath. \u201cSo Ares and Aphrodite,\u201d I said, to keep\nmy mind off the growing dark, \u201cthey have a thing going?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s old gossip, Percy,\u201d Annabeth told me. \u201cThree-thousand-year-old\ngossip.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Aphrodite\u2019s husband?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cHephaestus.

It was at least fifty yards across and shaped like a bowl.\nAround the rim, a dozen bronze statues of Cupid stood guard with wings\nspread and bows ready to fire. On the opposite side from us, a tunnel opened\nup, probably where the water flowed into when the pool was full. The sign\nabove it read, THRILL RIDE O\u2019 LOVE: THIS IS NOT YOUR PARENTS\u2019 TUNNEL OF\nLOVE!\n\n\fGrover crept toward the edge. \u201cGuys, look.\u201d\nMarooned at the bottom of the pool was a pink-and-white two-seater\nboat with a canopy over the top and little hearts painted all over it. In the left\nseat, glinting in the fading light, was Ares\u2019s shield, a polished circle of\nbronze.\n\u201cThis is too easy,\u201d I said. \u201cSo we just walk down there and get it?\u201d\nAnnabeth ran her fingers along the base of the nearest cupid statue.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Greek letter carved here,\u201d she said. \u201cEta. I wonder\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGrover,\u201d I said, \u201cyou smell any monsters?\u201d\nHe sniffed the wind. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2014like, in-the-Arch-and-you-didn\u2019t-smell-Echidna nothing, or\nreally nothing?\u201d\nGrover looked hurt. \u201cI told you, that was underground.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.

You\u2019re\nthe Red Baron, a flying ace, remember? I\u2019ll be counting on you for backup,\nin case something goes wrong.\u201d\nGrover puffed up his chest a little. \u201cSure. But what could go wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just a feeling. Annabeth, come with me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d She looked at me as if I\u2019d just dropped from the\nmoon. Her cheeks were bright red.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem now?\u201d I demanded.\n\u201cMe, go with you to the\u2026the \u2018Thrill Ride of Love\u2019? How embarrassing\nis that? What if somebody saw me?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to see you?\u201d But my face was burning now, too. Leave it\nto a girl to make everything complicated. \u201cFine,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019ll do it\nmyself.\u201d But when I started down the side of the pool, she followed me,\nmuttering about how boys always messed things up.\nWe reached the boat. The shield was propped on one seat, and next to it\nwas a lady\u2019s silk scarf. I tried to imagine Ares and Aphrodite here, a couple\nof gods meeting in a junked-out amusement-park ride. Why? Then I noticed\nsomething I hadn\u2019t seen from up top: mirrors all the way around the rim of\nthe pool, facing this spot. We could see ourselves no matter which direction\nwe looked.

I smiled, a little\ndreamy, and was about to rub the scarf against my cheek when Annabeth\nripped it out of my hand and stuffed it in her pocket. \u201cOh, no you don\u2019t. Stay\naway from that love magic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cJust get the shield, Seaweed Brain, and let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\nThe moment I touched the shield, I knew we were in trouble. My hand\nbroke through something that had been connecting it to the dashboard. A\ncobweb, I thought, but then I looked at a strand of it on my palm and saw it\nwas some kind of metal filament, so fine it was almost invisible. A trip wire.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Annabeth said.\n\u201cToo late.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s another Greek letter on the side of the boat, another Eta.

Before I could suggest taking cover, they shot, but not at us. They\nfired at each other, across the rim of the pool. Silky cables trailed from the\narrows, arcing over the pool and anchoring where they landed to form a huge\ngolden asterisk. Then smaller metallic threads started weaving together\nmagically between the main strands, making a net.\n\n\f\f\f\u201cWe have to get out,\u201d I said.\n\u201cDuh!\u201d Annabeth said.\nI grabbed the shield and we ran, but going up the slope of the pool was\nnot as easy as going down.\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Grover shouted.\nHe was trying to hold open a section of the net for us, but wherever he\ntouched it, the golden threads started to wrap around his hands.\nThe Cupids\u2019 heads popped open. Out came video cameras. Spotlights\nrose up all around the pool, blinding us with illumination, and a loudspeaker\nvoice boomed: \u201cLive to Olympus in one minute\u2026Fifty-nine seconds, fiftyeight\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHephaestus!\u201d Annabeth screamed. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid! Eta is \u2018H.\u2019 He made\nthis trap to catch his wife with Ares. Now we\u2019re going to be broadcast live to\nOlympus and look like absolute fools!\u201d\nWe\u2019d almost made it to the rim when the row of mirrors opened like\nhatches and thousands of tiny metallic\u2026things poured out.\nAnnabeth screamed.\nIt was an army of wind-up creepy-crawlies: bronze-gear bodies, spindly\nlegs, little pincer mouths, all scuttling toward us in a wave of clacking,\nwhirring metal.\n\n\u201cSpiders!\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cSp\u2014sp\u2014aaaah!\u201d\nI\u2019d never seen her like this before. She fell backward in terror and almost\ngot overwhelmed by the spider robots before I pulled her up and dragged her\nback toward the boat.\nThe things were coming out from all around the rim now, millions of\nthem, flooding toward the center of the pool, completely surrounding us. I\ntold myself they probably weren\u2019t programmed to kill, just corral us and bite\nus and make us look stupid. Then again, this was a trap meant for gods.

The strands were easy enough to break at first, but there were so\nmany of them, and the spiders just kept coming. I kicked one away from\nAnnabeth\u2019s leg and its pincers took a chunk out of my new surf shoe.\nGrover hovered above the pool in his flying sneakers, trying to pull the\nnet loose, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.\nThink, I told myself. Think.\nThe Tunnel of Love entrance was under the net. We could use it as an\nexit, except that it was blocked by a million robot spiders.\n\u201cFifteen, fourteen,\u201d the loudspeaker called.\nWater, I thought. Where does the ride\u2019s water come from?\nThen I saw them: huge water pipes behind the mirrors, where the spiders\nhad come from. And up above the net, next to one of the Cupids, a glasswindowed booth that must be the controller\u2019s station.\n\u201cGrover!\u201d I yelled. \u201cGet into that booth!

I had to get us out of there.\nGrover was in the controller\u2019s booth now, slamming away at the buttons.\n\u201cFive, four\u2014\u201d\nGrover looked up at me hopelessly, raising his hands. He was letting me\nknow that he\u2019d pushed every button, but still nothing was happening.\nI closed my eyes and thought about waves, rushing water, the Mississippi\nRiver. I felt a familiar tug in my gut. I tried to imagine that I was dragging\nthe ocean all the way to Denver.\n\u201cTwo, one, zero!\u201d\nWater exploded out of the pipes. It roared into the pool, sweeping away\nthe spiders. I pulled Annabeth into the seat next to me and fastened her seat\nbelt just as the tidal wave slammed into our boat, over the top, whisking the\nspiders away and dousing us completely, but not capsizing us. The boat\nturned, lifted in the flood, and spun in circles around the whirlpool.\n\n\fThe water was full of short-circuiting spiders, some of them smashing\nagainst the pool\u2019s concrete wall with such force they burst.\nSpotlights glared down at us. The Cupid-cams were rolling, live to\nOlympus.\nBut I could only concentrate on controlling the boat. I willed it to ride the\ncurrent, to keep away from the wall. Maybe it was my imagination, but the\nboat seemed to respond. At least, it didn\u2019t break into a million pieces. We\nspun around one last time, the water level now almost high enough to shred\nus against the metal net. Then the boat\u2019s nose turned toward the tunnel and\nwe rocketed through into the darkness.\nAnnabeth and I held tight, both of us screaming as the boat shot curls\nand hugged corners and took forty-five-degree plunges past pictures of\nRomeo and Juliet and a bunch of other Valentine\u2019s Day stuff.\nThen we were out of the tunnel, the night air whistling through our hair\nas the boat barreled straight toward the exit.\nIf the ride had been in working order, we would\u2019ve sailed off a ramp\nbetween the golden Gates of Love and splashed down safely in the exit pool.\nBut there was a problem.

If we\u2019d jumped when I thought we should\u2019ve, we\nwould\u2019ve crashed into the gates. She got us maximum lift.\nUnfortunately, that was a little more than we needed. Our boat smashed\ninto the pileup and we were thrown into the air, straight over the gates, over\nthe pool, and down toward solid asphalt.\n\nSomething grabbed me from behind.\nAnnabeth yelled, \u201cOuch!\u201d\nGrover!\nIn midair, he had grabbed me by the shirt, and Annabeth by the arm, and\nwas trying to pull us out of a crash landing, but Annabeth and I had all the\nmomentum.\n\u201cYou\u2019re too heavy!\u201d Grover said. \u201cWe\u2019re going down!\u201d\nWe spiraled toward the ground, Grover doing his best to slow the fall.\nWe smashed into a photo-board, Grover\u2019s head going straight into the\nhole where tourists would put their faces, pretending to be Noo-Noo the\nFriendly Whale.

I looked back at the Thrill Ride\nof Love. The water was subsiding. Our boat had been smashed to pieces\nagainst the gates.\n\n\fA hundred yards away, at the entrance pool, the Cupids were still\nfilming.

Good night!\u201d\nThe Cupids turned back to their original positions. The lights shut off.\nThe park went quiet and dark again, except for the gentle trickle of water\ninto the Thrill Ride of Love\u2019s exit pool. I wondered if Olympus had gone to\na commercial break, or if our ratings had been any good.\nI hated being teased. I hated being tricked.

At the register, the last two customers were\npaying their check, two men in identical black overalls, with a white logo on\ntheir backs that matched the one on the KINDNESS INTERNATIONAL truck.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re taking the zoo express,\u201d Grover said, \u201cwe need to hurry.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t like it, but we had no better option. Besides, I\u2019d seen enough of\nDenver.\nWe ran across the street and climbed in the back of the big rig, closing\nthe doors behind us.\nThe first thing that hit me was the smell. It was like the world\u2019s biggest pan\nof kitty litter.\nThe trailer was dark inside until I uncapped Anaklusmos. The blade cast\na faint bronze light over a very sad scene. Sitting in a row of filthy metal\ncages were three of the most pathetic zoo animals I\u2019d ever beheld: a zebra, a\nmale albino lion, and some weird antelope thing I didn\u2019t know the name for.\nSomeone had thrown the lion a sack of turnips, which he obviously\ndidn\u2019t want to eat. The zebra and the antelope had each gotten a Styrofoam\ntray of hamburger meat. The zebra\u2019s mane was matted with chewing gum,\nlike somebody had been spitting on it in their spare time. The antelope had a\nstupid silver birthday balloon tied to one of his horns that read OVER THE\nHILL!\n\n\fApparently, nobody had wanted to get close enough to the lion to mess\nwith him, but the poor thing was pacing around on soiled blankets, in a space\n\n\fway too small for him, panting from the stuffy heat of the trailer. He had\nflies buzzing around his pink eyes and his ribs showed through his white fur.\n\u201cThis is kindness?\u201d Grover yelled. \u201cHumane zoo transport?\u201d\nHe probably would\u2019ve gone right back outside to beat up the truckers\nwith his reed pipes, and I would\u2019ve helped him, but just then the truck\u2019s\nengine roared to life, the trailer started shaking, and we were forced to sit\ndown or fall down.\nWe huddled in the corner on some mildewed feed sacks, trying to ignore\nthe smell and the heat and the flies. Grover talked to the animals in a series\nof goat bleats, but they just stared at him sadly. Annabeth was in favor of\nbreaking the cages and freeing them on the spot, but I pointed out it wouldn\u2019t\ndo much good until the truck stopped moving. Besides, I had a feeling we\nmight look a lot better to the lion than those turnips.\nI found a water jug and refilled their bowls, then used Anaklusmos to\ndrag the mismatched food out of their cages. I gave the meat to the lion and\nthe turnips to the zebra and the antelope.\nGrover calmed the antelope down, while Annabeth used her knife to cut\nthe balloon off his horn. She wanted to cut the gum out of the zebra\u2019s mane,\ntoo, but we decided that would be too risky with the truck bumping around.\nWe told Grover to promise the animals we\u2019d help them more in the morning,\nthen we settled in for the night.\nGrover curled up on a turnip sack; Annabeth opened our bag of Double\nStuf Oreos and nibbled on one half-heartedly; I tried to cheer myself up by\nconcentrating on the fact that we were halfway to Los Angeles. Halfway to\nour destination. It was only June fourteenth. The solstice wasn\u2019t until the\ntwenty-first. We could make it in plenty of time.\nOn the other hand, I had no idea what to expect next.

Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have to.\nAnnabeth was asleep.\nI had trouble following her example, with Grover snoring and an albino\nlion staring hungrily at me, but eventually I closed my eyes.\nMy nightmare started out as something I\u2019d dreamed a million times before: I\nwas being forced to take a standardized test while wearing a straitjacket. All\nthe other kids were going out to recess, and the teacher kept saying, Come\non, Percy. You\u2019re not stupid, are you? Pick up your pencil.\nThen the dream strayed from the usual.\nI looked over at the next desk and saw a girl sitting there, also wearing a\nstraitjacket. She was my age, with unruly black, punk-style hair, dark\neyeliner around stormy green eyes, and freckles across her nose. Somehow, I\nknew who she was. She was Thalia, daughter of Zeus.\nShe struggled against the straitjacket, glared at me in frustration, and\nsnapped, Well, Seaweed Brain? One of us has to get out of here.\nShe\u2019s right, my dream-self thought. I\u2019m going back to that cavern. I\u2019m\ngoing to give Hades a piece of my mind.\nThe straitjacket melted off me. I fell through the classroom floor. The\nteacher\u2019s voice changed until it was cold and evil, echoing from the depths\nof a great chasm.\nPercy Jackson, it said. Yes, the exchange went well, I see.\n\n\fI was back in the dark cavern, spirits of the dead drifting around me.\nUnseen in the pit, the monstrous thing was speaking, but this time it wasn\u2019t\naddressing me. The numbing power of its voice seemed directed somewhere\nelse.\nAnd he suspects nothing? it asked.\nAnother voice, one I almost recognized, answered at my shoulder.\nNothing, my lord. He is as ignorant as the rest.\nI looked over, but no one was there. The speaker was invisible.\nDeception upon deception, the thing in the pit mused aloud. Excellent.\nTruly, my lord, said the voice next to me, you are well-named the\nCrooked One. But was it really necessary? I could have brought you what I\nstole directly\u2014\nYou? the monster said in scorn. You have already shown your limits. You\nwould have failed me completely had I not intervened.\nBut, my lord\u2014\nPeace, little servant. Our six months have brought us much. Zeus\u2019s anger\nhas grown.

I reached for her,\nonly to realize that my hands were withering to bones.

She just put on her magic cap and disappeared. Grover\nand I had to dive behind feed sacks and hope we looked like turnips.\nThe trailer doors creaked open. Sunlight and heat poured in.\n\u201cMan!\u201d one of the truckers said, waving his hand in front of his ugly\nnose. \u201cI wish I hauled appliances.\u201d He climbed inside and poured some\nwater from a jug into the animals\u2019 dishes.\n\u201cYou hot, big boy?\u201d he asked the lion, then splashed the rest of the\nbucket right in the lion\u2019s face.\nThe lion roared in indignation.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d the man said.\nNext to me, under the turnip sacks, Grover tensed. For a peace-loving\nherbivore, he looked downright murderous.\nThe trucker threw the antelope a squashed-looking Happy Meal bag. He\nsmirked at the zebra. \u201cHow ya doin\u2019, Stripes?

There was yelling and\nscreaming and cars honking. We rushed to the doors of the trailer in time to\nsee the zebra galloping down a wide boulevard lined with hotels and casinos\nand neon signs.

It was a hundred and ten\ndegrees, easy, and we must\u2019ve looked like deep-fried vagrants, but\n\n\feverybody was too interested in the wild animals to pay us much attention.\nWe passed the Monte Carlo and the MGM. We passed pyramids, a pirate\nship, and the Statue of Liberty, which was a pretty small replica, but still\nmade me homesick.\nI wasn\u2019t sure what we were looking for. Maybe just a place to get out of\nthe heat for a few minutes, find a sandwich and a glass of lemonade, make a\nnew plan for getting west.\nWe must have taken a wrong turn, because we found ourselves at a dead\nend, standing in front of the Lotus Hotel and Casino.

One\nlook at him, and I could see. Besides, I was so relieved to hear somebody\nwho sounded sympathetic that I nodded and said we\u2019d love to come in.\nInside, we took one look around, and Grover said, \u201cWhoa.\u201d\nThe whole lobby was a giant game room. And I\u2019m not talking about\ncheesy old Pac-Man games or slot machines. There was an indoor waterslide\nsnaking around the glass elevator, which went straight up at least forty\nfloors. There was a climbing wall on the side of one building, and an indoor\nbungee-jumping bridge. There were virtual-reality suits with working laser\nguns. And hundreds of video games, each one the size of a widescreen TV.\nBasically, you name it, this place had it. There were a few other kids playing,\nbut not that many. No waiting for any of the games. There were waitresses\nand snack bars all around, serving every kind of food you can imagine.\n\u201cHey!\u201d a bellhop said. At least I guessed he was a bellhop. He wore a\nwhite-and-yellow Hawaiian shirt with lotus designs, shorts, and flip-flops.\n\u201cWelcome to the Lotus Casino. Here\u2019s your room key.\u201d\nI stammered, \u201cUm, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThe bill\u2019s taken care of. No extra charges,\nno tips. Just go on up to the top floor, room 4001. If you need anything, like\nextra bubbles for the hot tub, or skeet targets for the shooting range, or\n\n\fwhatever, just call the front desk. Here are your LotusCash cards. They work\nin the restaurants and on all the games and rides.\u201d\nHe handed us each a green plastic credit card.\nI knew there must be some mistake. Obviously he thought we were some\nmillionaire\u2019s kids. But I took the card and said, \u201cHow much is on here?\u201d\nHis eyebrows knit together. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, when does it run out of cash?\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cOh, you\u2019re making a joke. Hey, that\u2019s cool. Enjoy your\nstay.\u201d\nWe took the elevator upstairs and checked out our room. It was a suite\nwith three separate bedrooms and a bar stocked with candy, sodas, and chips.\nA hotline to room service. Fluffy towels and water beds with feather pillows.\nA big-screen television with satellite and high-speed Internet. The balcony\nhad its own hot tub, and sure enough, there was a skeet-shooting machine\nand a shotgun, so you could launch clay pigeons right over the Las Vegas\nskyline and plug them with your gun. I didn\u2019t see how that could be legal,\nbut I thought it was pretty cool. The view over the Strip and the desert was\namazing, though I doubted we\u2019d ever find time to look at the view with a\nroom like this.\n\n\f\f\u201cOh, goodness,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cThis place is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSweet,\u201d Grover said. \u201cAbsolutely sweet.\u201d\nThere were clothes in the closet, and they fit me. I frowned, thinking that\nthis was a little strange.\nI threw Ares\u2019s backpack in the trash can. Wouldn\u2019t need that anymore.\nWhen we left, I could just charge a new one at the hotel store.\nI took a shower, which felt awesome after a week of grimy travel. I\nchanged clothes, ate a bag of chips, drank three Cokes, and came out feeling\nbetter than I had in a long time. In the back of my mind, some small problem\nkept nagging me. I\u2019d had a dream or something\u2026I needed to talk to my\nfriends.

We both held up our\ngreen plastic LotusCash cards.\n\u201cPlay time,\u201d I said.\nI couldn\u2019t remember the last time I had so much fun. I came from a\nrelatively poor family. Our idea of a splurge was eating out at Burger King\nand renting a video. A five-star Vegas hotel? Forget it.\nI bungee-jumped the lobby five or six times, did the waterslide,\nsnowboarded the artificial ski slope, and played virtual-reality laser tag and\nFBI sharpshooter. I saw Grover a few times, going from game to game. He\nreally liked the reverse hunter thing\u2014where the deer go out and shoot the\nrednecks. I saw Annabeth playing trivia games and other brainiac stuff. They\nhad this huge 3-D sim game where you build your own city, and you could\nactually see the holographic buildings rise on the display board. I didn\u2019t\nthink much of it, but Annabeth loved it.\nI\u2019m not sure when I first realized something was wrong.\n\n\fProbably, it was when I noticed the guy standing next to me at VR\nsharpshooters. He was about thirteen, I guess, but his clothes were weird. I\nthought he was some Elvis impersonator\u2019s son. He wore bell-bottom jeans\nand a red T-shirt with black piping, and his hair was permed and gelled like a\nNew Jersey girl\u2019s on homecoming night.\nWe played a game of sharpshooters together and he said, \u201cGroovy, man.\nBeen here two weeks, and the games keep getting better and better.\u201d\nGroovy?\nLater, while we were talking, I said something was \u201csick,\u201d and he looked\nat me kind of startled, as if he\u2019d never heard the word used that way before.\nHe said his name was Darrin, but as soon as I started asking him\nquestions he got bored with me and started to go back to the computer\nscreen.\nI said, \u201cHey, Darrin?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhat year is it?\u201d\nHe frowned at me. \u201cIn the game?\u201d\n\u201cNo. In real life.\u201d\nHe had to think about it. \u201c1977.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, getting a little scared. \u201cReally.\u201d\n\u201cHey, man. Bad vibes. I got a game happening.\u201d\nAfter that he totally ignored me.\nI started talking to people, and I found it wasn\u2019t easy. They were glued to\nthe TV screen, or the video game, or their food, or whatever. I found a guy\nwho told me it was 1985. Another guy told me it was 1993. They all claimed\nthey hadn\u2019t been in here very long, a few days, a few weeks at most. They\ndidn\u2019t really know and they didn\u2019t care.\nThen it occurred to me: how long had I been here?

His flying shoes sprang to life and started tugging his\nlegs in the other direction as he shouted, \u201cNo! I just got to a new level! No!\u201d\nThe Lotus bellhop hurried up to us. \u201cWell, now, are you ready for your\nplatinum cards?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d I told him.\n\u201cSuch a shame,\u201d he said, and I got the feeling that he really meant it, that\nwe\u2019d be breaking his heart if we went. \u201cWe just added an entire new floor\nfull of games for platinum-card members.\u201d\nHe held out the cards, and I wanted one. I knew that if I took one, I\u2019d\nnever leave. I\u2019d stay here, happy forever, playing games forever, and soon\nI\u2019d forget my mom, and my quest, and maybe even my own name. I\u2019d be\nplaying virtual rifleman with groovy Disco Darrin forever.\nGrover reached for the card, but Annabeth yanked back his arm and said,\n\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d\nWe walked toward the door, and as we did, the smell of the food and the\nsounds of the games seemed to get more and more inviting.

One day to complete\nour quest.\n\n\fI\n\nT WAS ANNABETH\u2019S IDEA.\n\nShe loaded us into the back of a Vegas taxi as if we actually had money,\nand told the driver, \u201cLos Angeles, please.\u201d\nThe cabbie chewed his cigar and sized us up. \u201cThat\u2019s three hundred\nmiles.

I told Annabeth and Grover about\nmy latest dream, but the details got sketchier the more I tried to remember\nthem. The Lotus Casino seemed to have short-circuited my memory. I\ncouldn\u2019t recall what the invisible servant\u2019s voice had sounded like, though I\nwas sure it was somebody I knew. The servant had called the monster in the\npit something other than \u201cmy lord\u201d\u2026some special name or title\u2026.\n\u201cThe Silent One?\u201d Annabeth suggested. \u201cThe Rich One? Both of those\nare nicknames for Hades.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d I said, though neither sounded quite right.\n\u201cThat throne room sounds like Hades\u2019s,\u201d Grover said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way\nit\u2019s usually described.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. The throne room wasn\u2019t the main\npart of the dream. And that voice from the pit\u2026I don\u2019t know. It just didn\u2019t\nfeel like a god\u2019s voice.\u201d\nAnnabeth\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOh\u2026nothing. I was just\u2014No, it has to be Hades. Maybe he sent this\nthief, this invisible person, to get the master bolt, and something went wrong\n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if he stole Zeus\u2019s symbol of power\nfrom Olympus, and the gods were hunting him, I mean, a lot of things could\ngo wrong. So this thief had to hide the bolt, or he lost it somehow. Anyway,\nhe failed to bring it to Hades. That\u2019s what the voice said in your dream,\nright? The guy failed. That would explain what the Furies were searching for\nwhen they came after us on the bus. Maybe they thought we had retrieved\nthe bolt.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t sure what was wrong with her. She looked pale.\n\u201cBut if I\u2019d already retrieved the bolt,\u201d I said. \u201cwhy would I be traveling\nto the Underworld?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cTo threaten Hades,\u201d Grover suggested. \u201cTo bribe or blackmail him into\ngetting your mom back.\u201d\nI whistled. \u201cYou have evil thoughts for a goat.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cBut the thing in the pit said it was waiting for two items,\u201d I said.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 339122, "end_char_idx": 342906, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6fb462c-17ed-48de-ab79-c64e62c5b9d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6fb462c-17ed-48de-ab79-c64e62c5b9d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8369e49-4685-4dc3-8d52-a9f50f7a7283", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "071c5ab44cdf6fe9fc2d4a98ce9c5e5fa880ea7bee20b1e51909c84c8d9a9988", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "404a0023-df1f-4e0f-bf60-df2ab50eb39a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c23a421d309c8e65b02c0a9ec0faa942d046f7e46f00bf7d73c5f26f39b1fc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So this thief had to hide the bolt, or he lost it somehow.

Because if it isn\u2019t Hades\u2026No. It has to be\nHades.\u201d\nWasteland rolled by. We passed a sign that said CALIFORNIA STATE LINE, 12\nMILES.\nI got the feeling I was missing one simple, critical piece of information.\nIt was like when I stared at a common word I should know, but I couldn\u2019t\nmake sense of it because one or two letters were floating around. The more I\nthought about my quest, the more I was sure that confronting Hades wasn\u2019t\nthe real answer. There was something else going on, something even more\ndangerous.\nThe problem was: we were hurtling toward the Underworld at ninetyfive miles an hour, betting that Hades had the master bolt. If we got there\nand found out we were wrong, we wouldn\u2019t have time to correct ourselves.\nThe solstice deadline would pass and war would begin.\n\u201cThe answer is in the Underworld,\u201d Annabeth assured me. \u201cYou saw\nspirits of the dead, Percy. There\u2019s only one place that could be. We\u2019re doing\nthe right thing.\u201d\nShe tried to boost our morale by suggesting clever strategies for getting\ninto the Land of the Dead, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. There were just too\nmany unknown factors. It was like cramming for a test without knowing the\nsubject. And believe me, I\u2019d done that enough times.\nThe cab sped west. Every gust of wind through Death Valley sounded\nlike a spirit of the dead. Every time the brakes hissed on an eighteenwheeler, it reminded me of Echidna\u2019s reptilian voice.\n\n\fAt sunset, the taxi dropped us at the beach in Santa Monica. It looked\nexactly the way L.A. beaches do in the movies, only it smelled worse. There\nwere carnival rides lining the Pier, palm trees lining the sidewalks, homeless\nguys sleeping in the sand dunes, and surfer dudes waiting for the perfect\nwave.\nGrover, Annabeth, and I walked down to the edge of the surf.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Annabeth asked.\nThe Pacific was turning gold in the setting sun. I thought about how long\nit had been since I\u2019d stood on the beach at Montauk, on the opposite side of\nthe country, looking out at a different sea.\nHow could there be a god who could control all that? What did my\nscience teacher use to say\u2014two-thirds of the earth\u2019s surface was covered in\nwater? How could I be the son of someone that powerful?\nI stepped into the surf.\n\u201cPercy?\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nI kept walking, up to my waist, then my chest.\nShe called after me, \u201cYou know how polluted that water is? There\u2019re all\nkinds of toxic\u2014\u201d\nThat\u2019s when my head went under.\nI held my breath at first. It\u2019s difficult to intentionally inhale water.\nFinally I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I gasped. Sure enough, I could breathe\nnormally.\nI walked down into the shoals.

I could make out sand-dollar colonies dotting\nthe sandbars. I could even see the currents, warm and cold streams swirling\ntogether.\nI felt something rub against my leg. I looked down and almost shot out\nof the water like a ballistic missile. Sliding along beside me was a five-footlong mako shark.\nBut the thing wasn\u2019t attacking. It was nuzzling me. Heeling like a dog.\nTentatively, I touched its dorsal fin. It bucked a little, as if inviting me to\nhold tighter. I grabbed the fin with both hands. It took off, pulling me along.\nThe shark carried me down into the darkness. It deposited me at the edge of\nthe ocean proper, where the sand bank dropped off into a huge chasm. It was\nlike standing on the rim of the Grand Canyon at midnight, not being able to\nsee much, but knowing the void was right there.\n\n\fThe surface shimmered maybe a hundred and fifty feet above. I knew I\nshould\u2019ve been crushed by the pressure. Then again, I shouldn\u2019t have been\nable to breathe. I wondered if there was a limit to how deep I could go, if I\ncould sink straight to the bottom of the Pacific.\nThen I saw something glimmering in the darkness below, growing bigger\nand brighter as it rose toward me. A woman\u2019s voice, like my mother\u2019s,\ncalled: \u201cPercy Jackson.\u201d\nAs she got closer, her shape became clearer. She had flowing black hair,\na dress made of green silk. Light flickered around her, and her eyes were so\ndistractingly beautiful I hardly noticed the stallion-sized sea horse she was\nriding.\nShe dismounted. The sea horse and the mako shark whisked off and\nstarted playing something that looked like tag. The underwater lady smiled\nat me. \u201cYou\u2019ve come far, Percy Jackson. Well done.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do, so I bowed. \u201cYou\u2019re the woman who\nspoke to me in the Mississippi River.\u201d\n\u201cYes, child. I am a Nereid, a spirit of the sea. It was not easy to appear so\nfar upriver, but the naiads, my freshwater cousins, helped sustain my life\nforce. They honor Lord Poseidon, though they do not serve in his court.\u201d\n\n\f\f\u201cAnd\u2026you serve in Poseidon\u2019s court?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cIt has been many years since a child of the Sea God has\nbeen born. We have watched you with great interest.\u201d\nSuddenly I remembered faces in the waves off Montauk Beach when I\nwas a little boy, reflections of smiling women. Like so many of the weird\nthings in my life, I\u2019d never given it much thought before.\n\u201cIf my father is so interested in me,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy isn\u2019t he here? Why\ndoesn\u2019t he speak to me?\u201d\nA cold current rose out of the depths.\n\u201cDo not judge the Lord of the Sea too harshly,\u201d the Nereid told me. \u201cHe\nstands at the brink of an unwanted war. He has much to occupy his time.\nBesides, he is forbidden to help you directly. The gods may not show such\nfavoritism.\u201d\n\u201cEven to their own children?\u201d\n\u201cEspecially to them. The gods can work by indirect influence only. That\nis why I give you a warning, and a gift.\u201d\nShe held out her hand. Three white pearls flashed in her palm.\n\n\u201cI know you journey to Hades\u2019s realm,\u201d she said. \u201cFew mortals have\never done this and survived: Orpheus, who had great music skill; Hercules,\n\n\fwho had great strength; Houdini, who could escape even the depths of\nTartarus.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 345380, "end_char_idx": 349166, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56ae249f-59aa-4fbe-8ac1-a883f043269e": {"__data__": {"id_": "56ae249f-59aa-4fbe-8ac1-a883f043269e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "404a0023-df1f-4e0f-bf60-df2ab50eb39a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "23fc3f550a6d35e92c940cf337ff2394c98d9741656294242d2d35bc863acd98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a19705e1-adbf-482c-b24c-25de922bbdf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad53a685048ff793f49c7285ab9fe5f862dc3f5b7b833a4bd91fbfbfb6206955", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Why\ndoesn\u2019t he speak to me?\u201d\nA cold current rose out of the depths.\n\u201cDo not judge the Lord of the Sea too harshly,\u201d the Nereid told me. \u201cHe\nstands at the brink of an unwanted war.

Do you have these talents?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026no, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cAh, but you have something else, Percy. You have gifts you have only\nbegun to know. The Oracles have foretold a great and terrible future for you,\nshould you survive to manhood. Poseidon would not have you die before\nyour time. Therefore take these, and when you are in need, smash a pearl at\nyour feet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will happen?\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d she said, \u201cdepends on the need. But remember: what belongs to\nthe sea will always return to the sea.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the warning?\u201d\nHer eyes flickered with green light. \u201cGo with what your heart tells you,\nor you will lose all. Hades feeds on doubt and hopelessness. He will trick\nyou if he can, make you mistrust your own judgment. Once you are in his\nrealm, he will never willingly let you leave. Keep faith. Good luck, Percy\nJackson.\u201d\nShe summoned her sea horse and rode toward the void.\n\u201cWait!\u201d I called. \u201cAt the river, you said not to trust the gifts. What gifts?\u201d\n\u201cGood-bye, young hero,\u201d she called back, her voice fading into the\ndepths. \u201cYou must listen to your heart.\u201d She became a speck of glowing\ngreen, and then she was gone.\nI wanted to follow her down into the darkness. I wanted to see the court\nof Poseidon. But I looked up at the sunset darkening on the surface. My\nfriends were waiting. We had so little time\u2026.\nI kicked upward toward the shore.\nWhen I reached the beach, my clothes dried instantly. I told Grover and\nAnnabeth what had happened, and showed them the pearls.\nAnnabeth grimaced. \u201cNo gift comes without a price.\u201d\n\u201cThey were free.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201c\u2018There is no such thing as a free lunch.\u2019\nThat\u2019s an ancient Greek saying that translated pretty well into American.\nThere will be a price. You wait.\u201d\nOn that happy thought, we turned our backs on the sea.\nWith some spare change from Ares\u2019s backpack, we took the bus into West\nHollywood. I showed the driver the Underworld address slip I\u2019d taken from\n\n\fAunty Em\u2019s Garden Gnome Emporium, but he\u2019d never heard of DOA\nRecording Studios.\n\u201cYou remind me of somebody I saw on TV,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou a child\nactor or something?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026I\u2019m a stunt double\u2026for a lot of child actors.\u201d\n\u201cOh! That explains it.\u201d\nWe thanked him and got off quickly at the next stop.\nWe wandered for miles on foot, looking for DOA. Nobody seemed to\nknow where it was. It didn\u2019t appear in the phone book.\nTwice, we ducked into alleys to avoid cop cars.\nI froze in front of an appliance-store window because a television was\nplaying an interview with somebody who looked very familiar\u2014my stepdad,\nSmelly Gabe. He was talking to Barbara Walters\u2014I mean, as if he were\nsome kind of huge celebrity. She was interviewing him in our apartment, in\nthe middle of a poker game, and there was a young blond lady sitting next to\nhim, patting his hand.\nA fake tear glistened on his cheek.

He was talking to Barbara Walters\u2014I mean, as if he were\nsome kind of huge celebrity. She was interviewing him in our apartment, in\nthe middle of a poker game, and there was a young blond lady sitting next to\nhim, patting his hand.\nA fake tear glistened on his cheek.

An adolescent boy with serious issues. Let me show you,\nagain, the last known photo of this troubled young fugitive, taken a week ago\nin Denver.\u201d\nThe screen cut to a grainy shot of me, Annabeth, and Grover standing\noutside the Colorado diner, talking to Ares.\n\u201cWho are the other children in this photo?\u201d Barbara Walters asked\ndramatically. \u201cWho is the man with them? Is Percy Jackson a delinquent, a\nterrorist, or perhaps the brainwashed victim of a frightening new cult? When\nwe come back, we chat with a leading child psychologist. Stay tuned,\nAmerica.\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Grover told me. He hauled me away before I could punch a\nhole in the appliance-store window.\nIt got dark, and hungry-looking characters started coming out on the\nstreets to play. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m a New Yorker. I don\u2019t scare\neasy. But L.A. had a totally different feel from New York. Back home,\neverything seemed close. It didn\u2019t matter how big the city was, you could get\n\n\fanywhere without getting lost. The street pattern and the subway made\nsense. There was a system to how things worked. A kid could be safe as long\nas he wasn\u2019t stupid.\nL.A. wasn\u2019t like that. It was spread out, chaotic, hard to move around. It\nreminded me of Ares. It wasn\u2019t enough for L.A. to be big; it had to prove it\nwas big by being loud and strange and difficult to navigate, too. I didn\u2019t\nknow how we were ever going to find the entrance to the Underworld by\ntomorrow, the summer solstice.\nWe walked past gangbangers, bums, and street hawkers, who looked at\nus like they were trying to figure if we were worth the trouble of mugging.\nAs we hurried past the entrance of an alley, a voice from the darkness\nsaid, \u201cHey, you.\u201d\nLike an idiot, I stopped.\nBefore I knew it, we were surrounded. A gang of kids had circled us. Six\nof them in all\u2014white kids with expensive clothes and mean faces. Like the\nkids at Yancy Academy: rich brats playing at being bad boys.\nInstinctively, I uncapped Riptide.\nWhen the sword appeared out of nowhere, the kids backed off, but their\nleader was either really stupid or really brave, because he kept coming at me\nwith a switchblade.\nI made the mistake of swinging.\nThe kid yelped. But he must\u2019ve been one hundred percent mortal,\nbecause the blade passed harmlessly right through his chest. He looked\ndown. \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d\nI figured I had about three seconds before his shock turned to anger.\n\u201cRun!\u201d I screamed at Annabeth and Grover.\nWe pushed two kids out of the way and raced down the street, not\nknowing where we were going.

He had gray, leathery\nskin, thick-lidded eyes, and a cold, reptilian smile. He moved toward us\nslowly, but I got the feeling he could move fast if he needed to.\nHis suit might\u2019ve come from the Lotus Casino. It belonged back in the\nseventies, big-time. The shirt was silk paisley, unbuttoned halfway down his\nhairless chest. The lapels on his velvet jacket were as wide as landing strips.\nThe gold chains around his neck\u2014I couldn\u2019t even count them.\n\n\f\f\u201cI\u2019m Crusty,\u201d he said, with a tartar-yellow smile.\nI resisted the urge to say, Yes, you are.\n\u201cSorry to barge in,\u201d I told him. \u201cWe were just, um, browsing.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean hiding from those no-good kids,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cThey hang\naround every night. I get a lot of people in here, thanks to them. Say, you\nwant to look at a water bed?\u201d\nI was about to say No, thanks, when he put a huge paw on my shoulder\nand steered me deeper into the showroom.\nThere was every kind of water bed you could imagine: different kinds of\nwood, different patterns of sheets; queen-size, king-size, emperor-of-theuniverse-size.\n\u201cThis is my most popular model.\u201d Crusty spread his hands proudly over\na bed covered with black satin sheets, with built-in Lava Lamps on the\nheadboard. The mattress vibrated, so it looked like oil-flavored Jell-O.\n\u201cMillion-hand massage,\u201d Crusty told us. \u201cGo on, try it out. Shoot, take a\nnap. I don\u2019t care.

Might fit.\u201d\nAnnabeth said, \u201cBut what\u2014\u201d\nHe patted her reassuringly on the shoulder and led her over to the Safari\nDeluxe model with teakwood lions carved into the frame and a leopardpatterned comforter. When Annabeth didn\u2019t want to lie down, Crusty pushed\nher.\n\u201cHey!\u201d she protested.\nCrusty snapped his fingers. \u201cErgo!\u201d\nRopes sprang from the sides of the bed, lashing around Annabeth,\nholding her to the mattress.\nGrover tried to get up, but ropes sprang from his black-satin bed, too,\nand lashed him down.\n\u201cN-not c-c-cool!\u201d he yelled, his voice vibrating from the million-hand\nmassage. \u201cN-not c-cool a-at all!\u201d\n\n\fThe giant looked at Annabeth, then turned toward me and grinned.\n\u201cAlmost, darn it.\u201d\nI tried to step away, but his hand shot out and clamped around the back\nof my neck. \u201cWhoa, kid.

I remembered the story: the giant who\u2019d tried to\nkill Theseus with excess hospitality on his way to Athens.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the salesman said. \u201cBut who can pronounce Procrustes? Bad for\nbusiness. Now \u2018Crusty,\u2019 anybody can say that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s got a good ring to it.\u201d\nHis eyes lit up. \u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the workmanship on these beds?\nFabulous!\u201d\nHe grinned hugely, but his fingers didn\u2019t loosen on my neck. \u201cI tell my\ncustomers that. Every time. Nobody bothers to look at the workmanship.\nHow many built-in Lava Lamp headboards have you seen?\u201d\n\u201cNot too many.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\n\u201cPercy!\u201d Annabeth yelled. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind her,\u201d I told Procrustes. \u201cShe\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\n\fThe giant laughed. \u201cAll my customers are. Never six feet exactly. So\ninconsiderate. And then they complain about the fitting.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you do if they\u2019re longer than six feet?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that happens all the time. It\u2019s a simple fix.\u201d\nHe let go of my neck, but before I could react, he reached behind a\nnearby sales desk and brought out a huge double-bladed brass ax. He said, \u201cI\njust center the subject as best I can and lop off whatever hangs over on either\nend.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, swallowing hard. \u201cSensible.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad to come across an intelligent customer!\u201d\nThe ropes were really stretching my friends now. Annabeth was turning\npale. Grover made gurgling sounds, like a strangled goose.\n\u201cSo, Crusty\u2026\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice light. I glanced at the\nsales tag on the valentine-shaped Honeymoon Special. \u201cDoes this one really\nhave dynamic stabilizers to stop wave motion?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely. Try it out.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, maybe I will. But would it work for a big guy like you? No waves\nat all?\u201d\n\u201cGuaranteed.\u201d\n\u201cNo way.\u201d\n\u201cWay.\u201d\n\u201cShow me.\u201d\nHe sat down eagerly on the bed, patted the mattress. \u201cNo waves.

We weren\u2019t going down anymore, but\nforward. The air turned misty. Spirits around me started changing shape.\nTheir modern clothes flickered, turning into gray hooded robes.

We weren\u2019t going down anymore, but\nforward. The air turned misty. Spirits around me started changing shape.\nTheir modern clothes flickered, turning into gray hooded robes. The floor of\nthe elevator began swaying.\nI blinked hard. When I opened my eyes, Charon\u2019s creamy Italian suit had\nbeen replaced by a long black robe. His tortoiseshell glasses were gone.\nWhere his eyes should\u2019ve been were empty sockets\u2014like Ares\u2019s eyes,\nexcept Charon\u2019s were totally dark, full of night and death and despair.\nHe saw me looking and said, \u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I managed.\nI thought he was grinning, but that wasn\u2019t it.

We were\nstanding in a wooden barge. Charon was poling us across a dark, oily river,\nswirling with bones, dead fish, and other, stranger things\u2014plastic dolls,\ncrushed carnations, soggy diplomas with gilt edges.\n\u201cThe River Styx,\u201d Annabeth murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPolluted,\u201d Charon said. \u201cFor thousands of years, you humans have been\nthrowing in everything as you come across\u2014hopes, dreams, wishes that\n\n\fnever came true. Irresponsible waste management, if you ask me.\u201d\nMist curled off the filthy water. Above us, almost lost in the gloom, was\na ceiling of stalactites. Ahead, the far shore glimmered with greenish light,\nthe color of poison.\nPanic closed up my throat. What was I doing here? These people around\nme\u2026they were dead.\nAnnabeth grabbed hold of my hand. Under normal circumstances, this\nwould\u2019ve embarrassed me, but I understood how she felt. She wanted\nreassurance that somebody else was alive on this boat.\nI found myself muttering a prayer, though I wasn\u2019t quite sure who I was\npraying to. Down here, only one god mattered, and he was the one I had\ncome to confront.\nThe shoreline of the Underworld came into view. Craggy rocks and black\nvolcanic sand stretched inland about a hundred yards to the base of a high\nstone wall, which marched off in either direction as far as we could see. A\nsound came from somewhere nearby in the green gloom, echoing off the\nstones\u2014the howl of a large animal.\n\u201cOld Three-Face is hungry,\u201d Charon said. His smile turned skeletal in the\ngreenish light. \u201cBad luck for you, godlings.\u201d\nThe bottom of our boat slid onto the black sand. The dead began to\ndisembark. A woman holding a little girl\u2019s hand. An old man and an old\nwoman hobbling along arm in arm. A boy no older than I was, shuffling\nsilently along in his gray robe.\nCharon said, \u201cI\u2019d wish you luck, mate, but there isn\u2019t any down here.\nMind you, don\u2019t forget to mention my pay raise.\u201d\nHe counted our golden coins into his pouch, then took up his pole. He\nwarbled something that sounded like a Barry Manilow song as he ferried the\nempty barge back across the river.\nWe followed the spirits up a well-worn path.\nI\u2019m not sure what I was expecting\u2014Pearly Gates, or a big black portcullis,\nor something. But the entrance to the Underworld looked like a cross\nbetween airport security and the Jersey Turnpike.\nThere were three separate entrances under one huge black archway that\nsaid YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EREBUS. Each entrance had a pass-through metal\ndetector with security cameras mounted on top. Beyond this were tollbooths\nmanned by black-robed ghouls like Charon.\n\n\fThe howling of the hungry animal was really loud now, but I couldn\u2019t\nsee where it was coming from.

We\u2019d seen him on TV a couple of\ntimes at the Yancy Academy dorm.

Sit!\u201d\nCerberus looked as stunned as we were.\nAll three of his heads cocked sideways.

I guess the dead didn\u2019t have to worry about little hazards\nlike being speared by stalactites the size of booster rockets.\nAnnabeth, Grover, and I tried to blend into the crowd, keeping an eye out\nfor security ghouls.

They\u2019re just sad.\nWe crept along, following the line of new arrivals that snaked from the\nmain gates toward a black-tented pavilion with a banner that read:\nJUDGMENTS FOR ELYSIUM AND\nETERNAL DAMNATION\nWelcome, Newly Deceased!\n\nOut the back of the tent came two much smaller lines.\nTo the left, spirits flanked by security ghouls were marched down a\nrocky path toward the Fields of Punishment, which glowed and smoked in\nthe distance, a vast, cracked wasteland with rivers of lava and minefields and\nmiles of barbed wire separating the different torture areas. Even from far\naway, I could see people being chased by hellhounds, burned at the stake,\nforced to run naked through cactus patches or listen to opera music. I could\njust make out a tiny hill, with the ant-size figure of Sisyphus struggling to\nmove his boulder to the top. And I saw worse tortures, too\u2014things I don\u2019t\nwant to describe.\nThe line coming from the right side of the judgment pavilion was much\nbetter.

It made me think of things I shouldn\u2019t even know\nabout\u2014blood spilled on an ancient stone altar, the foul breath of a murderer.\nThen I saw what was ahead of us, and I stopped dead in my tracks.\nThe tunnel widened into a huge dark cavern, and in the middle was a\nchasm the size of a city block.\nGrover was sliding straight toward the edge.\n\u201cCome on, Percy!\u201d Annabeth yelled, tugging at my wrist.\n\n\f\u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know!\u201d she shouted. \u201cThe place you described in your dream! But\nGrover\u2019s going to fall if we don\u2019t catch him.\u201d She was right, of course.\nGrover\u2019s predicament got me moving again.\nHe was yelling, clawing at the ground, but the winged shoes kept\ndragging him toward the pit, and it didn\u2019t look like we could possibly get to\nhim in time.\nWhat saved him were his hooves.\nThe flying sneakers had always been a loose fit on him, and finally\nGrover hit a big rock and the left shoe came flying off. It sped into the\ndarkness, down into the chasm. The right shoe kept tugging him along, but\nnot as fast. Grover was able to slow himself down by grabbing on to the big\nrock and using it like an anchor.\nHe was ten feet from the edge of the pit when we caught him and hauled\nhim back up the slope. The other winged shoe tugged itself off, circled\naround us angrily and kicked our heads in protest before flying off into the\nchasm to join its twin.\nWe all collapsed, exhausted, on the obsidian gravel. My limbs felt like\nlead. Even my backpack seemed heavier, as if somebody had filled it with\nrocks.\nGrover was scratched up pretty bad. His hands were bleeding. His eyes\nhad gone slit-pupiled, goat style, the way they did whenever he was terrified.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how\u2026\u201d he panted. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cListen.\u201d\nI heard something\u2014a deep whisper in the darkness.\nAnother few seconds, and Annabeth said, \u201cPercy, this place\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShh.\u201d I stood.\nThe sound was getting louder, a muttering, evil voice from far, far below\nus. Coming from the pit.\nGrover sat up. \u201cWh\u2014what\u2019s that noise?\u201d\nAnnabeth heard it too, now. I could see it in her eyes. \u201cTartarus. The\nentrance to Tartarus.\u201d\nI uncapped Anaklusmos.\nThe bronze sword expanded, gleaming in the darkness, and the evil voice\nseemed to falter, just for a moment, before resuming its chant.\nI could almost make out words now, ancient, ancient words, older even\nthat Greek. As if\u2026\n\n\f\u201cMagic,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d Annabeth said.\nTogether, we dragged Grover to his hooves and started back up the\ntunnel. My legs wouldn\u2019t move fast enough. My backpack weighed me\ndown. The voice got louder and angrier behind us, and we broke into a run.\nNot a moment too soon.\nA cold blast of wind pulled at our backs, as if the entire pit were\ninhaling. For a terrifying moment, I lost ground, my feet slipping in the\ngravel. If we\u2019d been any closer to the edge, we would\u2019ve been sucked in.\nWe kept struggling forward, and finally reached the top of the tunnel,\nwhere the cavern widened out into the Fields of Asphodel. The wind died. A\nwail of outrage echoed from deep in the tunnel. Something was not happy\nwe\u2019d gotten away.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Grover panted, when we\u2019d collapsed in the relative\nsafety of a black poplar grove. \u201cOne of Hades\u2019s pets?\u201d\nAnnabeth and I looked at each other.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 387983, "end_char_idx": 391748, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a2abae1-acfe-4c46-b27e-801d4e458783": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a2abae1-acfe-4c46-b27e-801d4e458783", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8974686-5da0-4dd2-a007-10f8aa7118b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "f84067be6bdd5d016db94cda3720fbc0dbe131fc3d47f03c4b7f01eeb6837fd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "19bbb61f-06be-4ba9-988a-635c8584244e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bcab65b5b3ace36ed5820ee9e5833cd4d7b0b50c3ccf5b4fd54473af0c18cb54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "My legs wouldn\u2019t move fast enough.

I could tell she was nursing an idea,\nprobably the same one she\u2019d gotten during the taxi ride to L.A., but she was\ntoo scared to share it. That was enough to terrify me.\nI capped my sword, put the pen back in my pocket. \u201cLet\u2019s keep going.\u201d I\nlooked at Grover. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d\nHe swallowed. \u201cYeah, sure. I never liked those shoes, anyway.\u201d\nHe tried to sound brave about it, but he was trembling as badly as\nAnnabeth and I were. Whatever was in that pit was nobody\u2019s pet. It was\nunspeakably old and powerful. Even Echidna hadn\u2019t given me that feeling. I\nwas almost relieved to turn my back on that tunnel and head toward the\npalace of Hades.\nAlmost.\nThe Furies circled the parapets, high in the gloom. The outer walls of the\nfortress glittered black, and the two-story-tall bronze gates stood wide open.\nUp close, I saw that the engravings on the gates were scenes of death.\nSome were from modern times\u2014an atomic bomb exploding over a city, a\ntrench filled with gas mask\u2013wearing soldiers, a line of African famine\nvictims waiting with empty bowls\u2014but all of them looked as if they\u2019d been\netched into the bronze thousands of years ago. I wondered if I was looking at\nprophecies that had come true.\n\n\fInside the courtyard was the strangest garden I\u2019d ever seen. Multicolored\nmushrooms, poisonous shrubs, and weird luminous plants grew without\nsunlight. Precious jewels made up for the lack of flowers, piles of rubies as\nbig as my fist, clumps of raw diamonds. Standing here and there like frozen\nparty guests were Medusa\u2019s garden statues\u2014petrified children, satyrs, and\ncentaurs\u2014all smiling grotesquely.\nIn the center of the garden was an orchard of pomegranate trees, their\norange blooms neon bright in the dark. \u201cThe garden of Persephone,\u201d\nAnnabeth said. \u201cKeep walking.\u201d\nI understood why she wanted to move on. The tart smell of those\npomegranates was almost overwhelming. I had a sudden desire to eat them,\nbut then I remembered the story of Persephone. One bite of Underworld\nfood, and we would never be able to leave. I pulled Grover away to keep him\nfrom picking a big juicy one.\nWe walked up the steps of the palace, between black columns, through a\nblack marble portico, and into the house of Hades. The entry hall had a\npolished bronze floor, which seemed to boil in the reflected torchlight. There\nwas no ceiling, just the cavern roof, far above. I guess they never had to\nworry about rain down here.\n\n\f\fEvery side doorway was guarded by a skeleton in military gear.

They grinned down at us,\nrocket-propelled grenade launchers held across their chests.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Grover mumbled, \u201cI bet Hades doesn\u2019t have trouble with\ndoor-to-door salesmen.\u201d\nMy backpack weighed a ton now.

I couldn\u2019t figure out why. I wanted to\nopen it, check to see if I had somehow picked up a stray bowling ball, but\nthis wasn\u2019t the time.\n\u201cWell, guys,\u201d I said. \u201cI suppose we should\u2026knock?\u201d\nA hot wind blew down the corridor, and the doors swung open. The\nguards stepped aside.\n\u201cI guess that means entrez-vous,\u201d Annabeth said.\nThe room inside looked just like in my dream, except this time the throne\nroom of Hades was occupied.\nHe was the third god I\u2019d met, but the first who really struck me as\ngodlike.\nHe was at least ten feet tall, for one thing, and dressed in black silk robes\nand a crown of braided gold. His skin was albino white, his hair shoulderlength and jet black. He wasn\u2019t bulked up like Ares, but he radiated power.\nHe lounged on his throne of fused human bones, looking lithe, graceful, and\ndangerous as a panther.\nI immediately felt like he should be giving the orders. He knew more\nthan I did. He should be my master. Then I told myself to snap out of it.\nHades\u2019s aura was affecting me, just as Ares\u2019s had. The Lord of the Dead\nresembled pictures I\u2019d seen of Adolph Hitler, or Napoleon, or the terrorist\nleaders who direct suicide bombers. Hades had the same intense eyes, the\nsame kind of mesmerizing, evil charisma.\n\u201cYou are brave to come here, Son of Poseidon,\u201d he said in an oily voice.\n\u201cAfter what you have done to me, very brave indeed. Or perhaps you are\nsimply very foolish.\u201d\nNumbness crept into my joints, tempting me to lie down and just take a\nlittle nap at Hades\u2019s feet. Curl up here and sleep forever.\nI fought the feeling and stepped forward. I knew what I had to say. \u201cLord\nand Uncle, I come with two requests.\u201d\nHades raised an eyebrow. When he sat forward in his throne, shadowy\nfaces appeared in the folds of his black robes, faces of torment, as if the\ngarments were stitched of trapped souls from the Fields of Punishment,\ntrying to get out. The ADHD part of me wondered, off-task, whether the rest\n\n\fof his clothes were made the same way. What horrible things would you\nhave to do in your life to get woven into Hades\u2019s underwear?\n\u201cOnly two requests?\u201d Hades said. \u201cArrogant child. As if you have not\nalready taken enough. Speak, then. It amuses me not to strike you dead yet.\u201d\nI swallowed. This was going about as well as I\u2019d feared.\nI glanced at the empty, smaller throne next to Hades\u2019s. It was shaped like\na black flower, gilded with gold. I wished Queen Persephone were here. I\nrecalled something in the myths about how she could calm her husband\u2019s\nmoods. But it was summer. Of course, Persephone would be above in the\nworld of light with her mother, the goddess of agriculture, Demeter. Her\nvisits, not the tilt of the planet, create the seasons.\nAnnabeth cleared her throat. Her finger prodded me in the back.\n\u201cLord Hades,\u201d I said. \u201cLook, sir, there can\u2019t be a war among the gods. It\nwould be\u2026bad.\u201d\n\u201cReally bad,\u201d Grover added helpfully.\n\u201cReturn Zeus\u2019s master bolt to me,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease, sir.

Debris fell from the cavern ceiling. Doors burst\nopen all along the walls, and skeletal warriors marched in, hundreds of them,\nfrom every time period and nation in Western civilization. They lined the\nperimeter of the room, blocking the exits.\nHades bellowed, \u201cDo you think I want war, godling?\u201d\nI wanted to say, Well, these guys don\u2019t look like peace activists. But I\nthought that might be a dangerous answer.\n\u201cYou are the Lord of the Dead,\u201d I said carefully. \u201cA war would expand\nyour kingdom, right?\u201d\n\u201cA typical thing for my brothers to say!

Double overtime for the staff. I used to be a rich god, Percy\nJackson. I control all the precious metals under the earth.

Problems everywhere, and I\u2019ve got to\nhandle all of them personally. The commute time alone from the palace to\nthe gates is enough to drive me insane! And the dead just keep arriving.

Hades rose from his throne, towering to the\nheight of a football goalpost. \u201cYour father may fool Zeus, boy, but I am not\nso stupid. I see his plan.\u201d\n\u201cHis plan?\u201d\n\u201cYou were the thief on the winter solstice,\u201d he said. \u201cYour father thought\nto keep you his little secret. He directed you into the throne room on\nOlympus. You took the master bolt and my helm. Had I not sent my Fury to\ndiscover you at Yancy Academy, Poseidon might have succeeded in hiding\nhis scheme to start a war. But now you have been forced into the open. You\nwill be exposed as Poseidon\u2019s thief, and I will have my helm back!\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Annabeth spoke.

I can ill afford for word to get out that my\nmost powerful weapon of fear is missing. So I searched for you myself, and\n\n\fwhen it was clear you were coming to me to deliver your threat, I did not try\nto stop you.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t try to stop us? But\u2014\u201d\n\u201cReturn my helm now, or I will stop death,\u201d Hades threatened. \u201cThat is\nmy counterproposal. I will open the earth and have the dead pour back into\nthe world. I will make your lands a nightmare. And you, Percy Jackson\u2014\nyour skeleton will lead my army out of Hades.\u201d\nThe skeletal soldiers all took one step forward, making their weapons\nready.\nAt that point, I probably should have been terrified. The strange thing\nwas, I felt offended. Nothing gets me angrier than being accused of\nsomething I didn\u2019t do. I\u2019ve had a lot of experience with that.\n\u201cYou\u2019re as bad as Zeus,\u201d I said. \u201cYou think I stole from you? That\u2019s why\nyou sent the Furies after me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Hades said.\n\u201cAnd the other monsters?\u201d\nHades curled his lip. \u201cI had nothing to do with them.

The weight in my backpack, like a bowling\nball. It couldn\u2019t be\u2026.\nI slung it off my shoulder and unzipped it. Inside was a two-foot-long\nmetal cylinder, spiked on both ends, humming with energy.\n\u201cPercy,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cHow\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cYou heroes are always the same,\u201d Hades said. \u201cYour pride makes you\nfoolish, thinking you could bring such a weapon before me.

Where is it?\u201d\n\n\fI was speechless. I had no helm. I had no idea how the master bolt had\ngotten into my backpack. I wanted to think Hades was pulling some kind of\ntrick.

For a scary moment, nothing\nhappened.\nHades yelled, \u201cDestroy them!\u201d\nThe army of skeletons rushed forward, swords out, guns clicking to full\nautomatic. The Furies lunged, their whips bursting into flame.\nJust as the skeletons opened fire, the pearl fragments at my feet exploded\nwith a burst of green light and a gust of fresh sea wind. I was encased in a\nmilky white sphere, which was starting to float off the ground.\nAnnabeth and Grover were right behind me. Spears and bullets sparked\nharmlessly off the pearl bubbles as we floated up. Hades yelled with such\nrage, the entire fortress shook and I knew it was not going to be a peaceful\nnight in L.A.\n\n\f\f\u201cLook up!\u201d Grover yelled. \u201cWe\u2019re going to crash!\u201d\nSure enough, we were racing right toward the stalactites, which I figured\nwould pop our bubbles and skewer us.\n\u201cHow do you control these things?\u201d Annabeth shouted.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you do!\u201d I shouted back.\nWe screamed as the bubbles slammed into the ceiling and\u2026Darkness.\nWere we dead?\nNo, I could still feel the racing sensation. We were going up, right\nthrough solid rock as easily as an air bubble in water. That was the power of\nthe pearls, I realized\u2014What belongs to the sea will always return to the sea.\nFor a few moments, I couldn\u2019t see anything outside the smooth walls of\nmy sphere, then my pearl broke through on the ocean floor. The two other\nmilky spheres, Annabeth and Grover, kept pace with me as we soared\nupward through the water. And\u2014ker-blam!\nWe exploded on the surface, in the middle of the Santa Monica Bay,\nknocking a surfer off his board with an indignant, \u201cDude!\u201d\nI grabbed Grover and hauled him over to a life buoy. I caught Annabeth\nand dragged her over too. A curious shark was circling us, a great white\nabout eleven feet long.\nI said, \u201cBeat it.\u201d\nThe shark turned and raced away.\nThe surfer screamed something about bad mushrooms and paddled away\nfrom us as fast as he could.\nSomehow, I knew what time it was: early morning, June 21, the day of\nthe summer solstice.\nIn the distance, Los Angeles was on fire, plumes of smoke rising from\nneighborhoods all over the city.

There had been an earthquake, all right, and\nit was Hades\u2019s fault.

There was a disaster to mop up. Their radios were\njammed with distress calls.\nThey dropped us off at the Santa Monica Pier with towels around our\nshoulders and water bottles that said I\u2019M A JUNIOR COAST GUARD! and sped off\nto save more people.\nOur clothes were sopping wet, even mine. When the Coast Guard boat\nhad appeared, I\u2019d silently prayed they wouldn\u2019t pick me out of the water and\nfind me perfectly dry, which might\u2019ve raised some eyebrows. So I\u2019d willed\nmyself to get soaked. Sure enough, my usual waterproof magic had\nabandoned me. I was also barefoot, because I\u2019d given my shoes to Grover.\nBetter the Coast Guard wonder why one of us was barefoot than wonder why\none of us had hooves.\nAfter reaching dry land, we stumbled down the beach, watching the city\nburn against a beautiful sunrise. I felt as if I\u2019d just come back from the dead\n\n\f\u2014which I had. My backpack was heavy with Zeus\u2019s master bolt. My heart\nwas even heavier from seeing my mother.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cWe went all that way\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt was a trick,\u201d I said. \u201cA strategy worthy of Athena.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d she warned.\n\u201cYou get it, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe dropped her eyes, her anger fading. \u201cYeah.

Hades didn\u2019t want war among the Big\nThree. Someone else pulled off the theft. Someone stole Zeus\u2019s master bolt,\nand Hades\u2019s helm, and framed me because I\u2019m Poseidon\u2019s kid. Poseidon will\nget blamed by both sides. By sundown today, there will be a three-way war.\nAnd I\u2019ll have caused it.\u201d\nGrover shook his head, mystified. \u201cBut who would be that sneaky? Who\nwould want war that bad?\u201d\nI stopped in my tracks, looking down the beach. \u201cGee, let me think.\u201d\nThere he was, waiting for us, in his black leather duster and sunglasses,\nan aluminum baseball bat propped on his shoulder.

Oh yeah, Hades will be mad at\nboth Zeus and Poseidon, because he doesn\u2019t know who took this.

Nothing like\nwatching your relatives fight, I always say.\u201d\n\u201cYou gave me the backpack in Denver,\u201d I said. \u201cThe master bolt was in\nthere the whole time.\u201d\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d Ares said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably too complicated for your little\nmortal brain to follow, but the backpack is the master bolt\u2019s sheath, just\nmorphed a bit. The bolt is connected to it, sort of like that sword you got,\nkid. It always returns to your pocket, right?\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t sure how Ares knew about that, but I guess a god of war had to\nmake it his business to know about weapons.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Ares continued. \u201cI tinkered with the magic a bit, so the bolt\nwould only return to the sheath once you reached the Underworld. You get\nclose to Hades\u2026Bingo, you got mail. If you died along the way\u2014no loss.

Better to have you caught\nredhanded, holding the thing.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d I said. \u201cSending the bolt to the Underworld wasn\u2019t your\nidea, was it?\u201d\n\u201cOf course it was!\u201d Smoke drifted up from his sunglasses, as if they were\nabout to catch fire.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t order the theft,\u201d I guessed. \u201cSomeone else sent a hero to\nsteal the two items. Then, when Zeus sent you to hunt him down, you caught\n\n\fthe thief. But you didn\u2019t turn him over to Zeus. Something convinced you to\nlet him go.

I thought back to what Annabeth had\nsaid at the Denver diner, so long ago: Ares has strength. That\u2019s all he has.\nEven strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes.\nHe cleaved downward at my head, but I wasn\u2019t there.\nMy body thought for me. The water seemed to push me into the air and I\ncatapulted over him, slashing as I came down. But Ares was just as quick.\nHe twisted, and the strike that should\u2019ve caught him directly in the spine was\ndeflected off the end of his sword hilt.\nHe grinned. \u201cNot bad, not bad.\u201d\nHe slashed again and I was forced to jump onto dry land. I tried to\nsidestep, to get back to the water, but Ares seemed to know what I wanted.\nHe outmaneuvered me, pressing so hard I had to put all my concentration on\nnot getting sliced into pieces. I kept backing away from the surf. I couldn\u2019t\nfind any openings to attack. His sword had a reach several feet longer than\nAnaklusmos.\nGet in close, Luke told me once, back in our sword class. When you\u2019ve\ngot the shorter blade, get in close.\nI stepped inside with a thrust, but Ares was waiting for that. He knocked\nmy blade out of my hands and kicked me in the chest. I went airborne\u2014\ntwenty, maybe thirty feet. I would\u2019ve broken my back if I hadn\u2019t crashed into\nthe soft sand of a dune.\n\u201cPercy!\u201d Annabeth yelled. \u201cCops!\u201d\nI was seeing double. My chest felt like it had just been hit with a\nbattering ram, but I managed to get to my feet.\nI couldn\u2019t look away from Ares for fear he\u2019d slice me in half, but out of\nthe corner of my eye I saw red lights flashing on the shoreline boulevard.\nCar doors were slamming.\n\u201cThere, officer!\u201d somebody yelled. \u201cSee?\u201d\nA gruff cop voice: \u201cLooks like that kid on TV\u2026what the heck\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s armed,\u201d another cop said. \u201cCall for backup.\u201d\nI rolled to one side as Ares\u2019s blade slashed the sand.\nI ran for my sword, scooped it up, and launched a swipe at Ares\u2019s face,\nonly to find my blade deflected again.\nAres seemed to know exactly what I was going to do the moment before\nI did it.\nI stepped back toward the surf, forcing him to follow.\n\n\f\u201cAdmit it, kid,\u201d Ares said. \u201cYou got no hope.

Little waves, I thought. And the water behind me\n\n\fseemed to recede. I was holding back the tide by force of will, but tension\nwas building, like carbonation behind a cork.\nAres came toward me, grinning confidently. I lowered my blade, as if I\nwere too exhausted to go on. Wait for it, I told the sea. The pressure now was\nalmost lifting me off my feet. Ares raised his sword. I released the tide and\njumped, rocketing straight over Ares on a wave.\nA six-foot wall of water smashed him full in the face, leaving him\ncursing and sputtering with a mouth full of seaweed. I landed behind him\nwith a splash and feinted toward his head, as I\u2019d done before. He turned in\ntime to raise his sword, but this time he was disoriented, he didn\u2019t anticipate\nthe trick.

I picked it up and walked toward my friends.\n\nBut before I got there, I heard the flapping of leathery wings. Three evillooking grandmothers with lace hats and fiery whips drifted down from the\nsky and landed in front of me.\nThe middle Fury, the one who had been Mrs. Dodds, stepped forward.\nHer fangs were bared, but for once she didn\u2019t look threatening. She looked\nmore disappointed, as if she\u2019d been planning to have me for supper, but had\ndecided I might give her indigestion.\n\u201cWe saw the whole thing,\u201d she hissed. \u201cSo\u2026it truly was not you?\u201d\nI tossed her the helmet, which she caught in surprise.\n\u201cReturn that to Lord Hades,\u201d I said. \u201cTell him the truth.

Because if you do not, if you\never come into my clutches again\u2026\u201d\nShe cackled, savoring the idea. Then she and her sisters rose on their\nbats\u2019 wings, fluttered into the smoke-filled sky, and disappeared.\nI joined Grover and Annabeth, who were staring at me in amazement.\n\u201cPercy\u2026\u201d Grover said. \u201cThat was so incredibly\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTerrifying,\u201d said Annabeth.\n\u201cCool!\u201d Grover corrected.\n\n\fI didn\u2019t feel terrified.

He\u2019d\ncaused a commotion on that Greyhound bus in New Jersey trying to get\naway from his captor (and afterward, witnesses would even swear they had\nseen the leather-clad man on the bus\u2014\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I remember him\nbefore?\u201d). The crazy man had caused the explosion in the St. Louis Arch.\n\n\fAfter all, no kid could\u2019ve done that. A concerned waitress in Denver had\nseen the man threatening his abductees outside her diner, gotten a friend to\ntake a photo, and notified the police. Finally, brave Percy Jackson (I was\nbeginning to like this kid) had stolen a gun from his captor in Los Angeles\nand battled him shotgun-to-rifle on the beach. Police had arrived just in time.\nBut in the spectacular explosion, five police cars had been destroyed and the\ncaptor had fled. No fatalities had occurred. Percy Jackson and his two\nfriends were safely in police custody.\nThe reporters fed us this whole story. We just nodded and acted tearful\nand exhausted (which wasn\u2019t hard), and played victimized kids for the\ncameras.\n\u201cAll I want,\u201d I said, choking back my tears, \u201cis to see my loving\nstepfather again. Every time I saw him on TV, calling me a delinquent punk,\nI knew\u2026somehow\u2026we would be okay. And I know he\u2019ll want to reward\neach and every person in this beautiful city of Los Angeles with a free major\nappliance from his store. Here\u2019s the phone number.\u201d The police and reporters\nwere so moved that they passed around the hat and raised money for three\ntickets on the next plane to New York.\nI knew there was no choice but to fly. I hoped Zeus would cut me some\nslack, considering the circumstances. But it was still hard to force myself on\nboard the flight.\nTakeoff was a nightmare. Every spot of turbulence was scarier than a\nGreek monster. I didn\u2019t unclench my hands from the armrests until we\ntouched down safely at LaGuardia. The local press was waiting for us\noutside security, but we managed to evade them thanks to Annabeth, who\nlured them away in her invisible Yankees cap, shouting, \u201cThey\u2019re over by\nthe frozen yogurt! Come on!,\u201d then rejoined us at baggage claim.\nWe split up at the taxi stand. I told Annabeth and Grover to get back to\nHalf-Blood Hill and let Chiron know what had happened. They protested,\nand it was hard to let them go after all we\u2019d been through, but I knew I had\nto do this last part of the quest by myself. If things went wrong, if the gods\ndidn\u2019t believe me\u2026I wanted Annabeth and Grover to survive to tell Chiron\nthe truth.\nI hopped in a taxi and headed into Manhattan.\nThirty minutes later, I walked into the lobby of the Empire State Building.\n\n\fI must have looked like a homeless kid, with my tattered clothes and my\nscraped-up face.

The doors slid open. I stepped out and almost had a heart\nattack.\nI was standing on a narrow stone walkway in the middle of the air.\nBelow me was Manhattan, from the height of an airplane. In front of me,\nwhite marble steps wound up the spine of a cloud, into the sky. My eyes\nfollowed the stairway to its end, where my brain just could not accept what I\nsaw.\nLook again, my brain said.\nWe\u2019re looking, my eyes insisted. It\u2019s really there.\nFrom the top of the clouds rose the decapitated peak of a mountain, its\nsummit covered with snow. Clinging to the mountainside were dozens of\nmultileveled palaces\u2014a city of mansions\u2014all with white-columned\nporticos, gilded terraces, and bronze braziers glowing with a thousand fires.\nRoads wound crazily up to the peak, where the largest palace gleamed\nagainst the snow. Precariously perched gardens bloomed with olive trees and\nrosebushes. I could make out an open-air market filled with colorful tents, a\nstone amphitheater built on one side of the mountain, a hippodrome and a\ncoliseum on the other. It was an ancient Greek city, except it wasn\u2019t in ruins.\nIt was new, and clean, and colorful, the way Athens must\u2019ve looked twentyfive hundred years ago.\nThis place can\u2019t be here, I told myself.

Nobody seemed\nworried about an impending civil war. In fact, everybody seemed in a festive\nmood. Several of them turned to watch me pass, and whispered to\nthemselves.\n\n\fI climbed the main road, toward the big palace at the peak. It was a\nreverse copy of the palace in the Underworld. There, everything had been\nblack and bronze. Here, everything glittered white and silver.\nI realized Hades must\u2019ve built his palace to resemble this one. He wasn\u2019t\nwelcomed in Olympus except on the winter solstice, so he\u2019d built his own\nOlympus underground. Despite my bad experience with him, I felt a little\nsorry for the guy. To be banished from this place seemed really unfair. It\nwould make anybody bitter.\nSteps led up to a central courtyard. Past that, the throne room.\nRoom really isn\u2019t the right word. The place made Grand Central Station\nlook like a broom closet. Massive columns rose to a domed ceiling, which\nwas gilded with moving constellations.\nTwelve thrones, built for beings the size of Hades, were arranged in an\ninverted U, just like the cabins at Camp Half-Blood. An enormous fire\ncrackled in the central hearth pit. The thrones were empty except for two at\nthe end: the head throne on the right, and the one to its immediate left. I\ndidn\u2019t have to be told who the two gods were that were sitting there, waiting\nfor me to approach. I came toward them, my legs trembling.\nThe gods were in giant human form, as Hades had been, but I could\nbarely look at them without feeling a tingle, as if my body were starting to\nburn. Zeus, the Lord of the Gods, wore a dark blue pinstriped suit. He sat on\na simple throne of solid platinum. He had a well-trimmed beard, marbled\ngray and black like a storm cloud. His face was proud and handsome and\ngrim, his eyes rainy gray. As I got nearer to him, the air crackled and smelled\nof ozone.\n\n\f\fThe god sitting next to him was his brother, without a doubt, but he was\ndressed very differently. He reminded me of a beachcomber from Key West.\nHe wore leather sandals, khaki Bermuda shorts, and a Tommy Bahama shirt\nwith coconuts and parrots all over it. His skin was deeply tanned, his hands\nscarred like an old-time fisherman\u2019s. His hair was dark, like mine. His face\nhad the same brooding look that had always gotten me branded as a rebel.\nBut his eyes, sea-green like mine, were surrounded by sun-crinkles that told\nme he smiled a lot, too.\nHis throne was a deep-sea fisherman\u2019s chair. It was a simple swiveling\nkind, with a black leather seat and a built-in holster for a fishing pole.\nInstead of a pole, the holster held a bronze trident, flickering with green light\naround the tips.\n\n\f\fThe gods weren\u2019t moving or speaking, but there was tension in the air, as\nif they\u2019d just finished an argument.\nI approached the fisherman\u2019s throne and knelt at his feet. \u201cFather.\u201d I\ndared not look up. My heart was racing. I could feel the energy emanating\nfrom the two gods. If I said the wrong thing, I had no doubt they could blast\nme into dust.\nTo my left, Zeus spoke. \u201cShould you not address the master of this house\nfirst, boy?\u201d\nI kept my head down, and waited.\n\u201cPeace, brother,\u201d Poseidon finally said.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 433163, "end_char_idx": 437020, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f82b8c5-c9e2-4efd-a6c0-c330b43ad3e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f82b8c5-c9e2-4efd-a6c0-c330b43ad3e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94491675-6e4e-4425-a1a4-bc6836afed86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "d97efb4a79c5a55310855b175957a1cab87ac71e71e695a80c02210c4b3e8aff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c317b43-e456-4b4d-8b8a-54b2a23e2eea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/armansiddiqui/GitHub/RAGTool/book/book1.txt", "file_name": "book1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 505209, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-10"}, "hash": "f13a054ab0fa9a1304e587fdb6e830e14545a9811587d07a6d6c5fba6d390041", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "278753fb-b760-4785-abeb-dfc65494c8ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2406ff957e63fe235e3ac6faab49dd6f2abb053e3b032ed4b78f68afccb5d325", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "His throne was a deep-sea fisherman\u2019s chair.

This is only right.\u201d\n\u201cYou still claim him then?\u201d Zeus asked, menacingly. \u201cYou claim this\nchild whom you sired against our sacred oath?\u201d\n\u201cI have admitted my wrongdoing,\u201d Poseidon said. \u201cNow I would hear\nhim speak.\u201d\nWrongdoing.\nA lump welled up in my throat. Was that all I was? A wrongdoing? The\nresult of a god\u2019s mistake?\n\u201cI have spared him once already,\u201d Zeus grumbled. \u201cDaring to fly through\nmy domain\u2026pah! I should have blasted him out of the sky for his\nimpudence.\u201d\n\u201cAnd risk destoying your own master bolt?\u201d Poseidon asked calmly. \u201cLet\nus hear him out, brother.\u201d\nZeus grumbled some more. \u201cI shall listen,\u201d he decided. \u201cThen I shall\nmake up my mind whether or not to cast this boy down from Olympus.\u201d\n\u201cPerseus,\u201d Poseidon said. \u201cLook at me.\u201d\nI did, and I wasn\u2019t sure what I saw in his face. There was no clear sign of\nlove or approval. Nothing to encourage me. It was like looking at the ocean:\nsome days you could tell what mood it was in. Most days, though, it was\nunreadable, mysterious.\nI got the feeling Poseidon really didn\u2019t know what to think of me. He\ndidn\u2019t know whether he was happy to have me as a son or not. In a strange\nway, I was glad that Poseidon was so distant. If he\u2019d tried to apologize, or\ntold me he loved me, or even smiled, it would\u2019ve felt fake. Like a human\ndad, making some lame excuse for not being around. I could live with that.\nAfter all, I wasn\u2019t sure about him yet, either.\n\n\f\u201cAddress Lord Zeus, boy,\u201d Poseidon told me. \u201cTell him your story.\u201d\nSo I told Zeus everything, just as it had happened. I took out the metal\ncylinder, which began sparking in the Sky God\u2019s presence, and laid it at his\nfeet.\nThere was a long silence, broken only by the crackle of the hearth fire.\nZeus opened his palm. The lightning bolt flew into it. As he closed his\nfist, the metallic points flared with electricity, until he was holding what\nlooked more like the classic thunderbolt, a twenty-foot javelin of arcing,\nhissing energy that made the hairs on my scalp rise.\n\u201cI sense the boy tells the truth,\u201d Zeus muttered. \u201cBut that Ares would do\nsuch a thing\u2026it is most unlike him.\u201d\n\u201cHe is proud and impulsive,\u201d Poseidon said. \u201cIt runs in the family.\u201d\n\u201cLord?\u201d I asked.\nThey both said, \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cAres didn\u2019t act alone.

Something\npowerful and evil is stirring down there\u2026something even older than the\ngods.\u201d\nPoseidon and Zeus looked at each other. They had a quick, intense\ndiscussion in ancient Greek. I only caught one word. Father.\nPoseidon made some kind of suggestion, but Zeus cut him off. Poseidon\ntried to argue. Zeus held up his hand angrily. \u201cWe will speak of this no\nmore,\u201d Zeus said. \u201cI must go personally to purify this thunderbolt in the\nwaters of Lemnos, to remove the human taint from its metal.\u201d\nHe rose and looked at me.

Zeus cast Kronos\u2019s remains into the darkest pit of Tartarus. The\nTitan army was scattered, their mountain fortress on Etna destroyed, their\nmonstrous allies driven to the farthest corners of the earth. And yet Titans\ncannot die, any more than we gods can. Whatever is left of Kronos is still\nalive in some hideous way, still conscious in his eternal pain, still hungering\nfor power.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s healing,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back.\u201d\nPoseidon shook his head. \u201cFrom time to time, over the eons, Kronos has\nstirred. He enters men\u2019s nightmares and breathes evil thoughts. He wakens\nrestless monsters from the depths.

That\u2019s what he said.\u201d\nPoseidon was silent for a long time.\n\u201cLord Zeus has closed discussion on this matter. He will not allow talk of\nKronos. You have completed your quest, child.

Gabe had hit my mother. I didn\u2019t\nknow when, or how much. But I was sure he\u2019d done it. Maybe it had been\ngoing on for years, when I wasn\u2019t around.\n\n\fA balloon of anger started expanding in my chest. I came toward Gabe,\ninstinctively taking my pen out of my pocket.\nHe just laughed. \u201cWhat, punk? You gonna write on me? You touch me,\nand you are going to jail forever, you understand?\u201d\n\u201cHey, Gabe,\u201d his friend Eddie interrupted. \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid,\u201d\nGabe looked at him resentfully and mimicked in a falsetto voice: \u201cJust a\nkid.\u201d\nHis other friends laughed like idiots.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be nice to you, punk.\u201d Gabe showed me his tobacco-stained teeth.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you five minutes to get your stuff and clear out. After that, I call\nthe police.\u201d\n\u201cGabe!\u201d my mother pleaded.\n\u201cHe ran away,\u201d Gabe told her. \u201cLet him stay gone.\u201d\nI was itching to uncap Riptide, but even if I did, the blade wouldn\u2019t hurt\nhumans.

I could start my very own\nstatue garden, right there in the living room.\nThat\u2019s what a Greek hero would do in the stories, I thought. That\u2019s what\nGabe deserves.\nBut a hero\u2019s story always ended in tragedy. Poseidon had told me that.\nI remembered the Underworld. I thought about Gabe\u2019s spirit drifting\nforever in the Fields of Asphodel, or condemned to some hideous torture\nbehind the barbed wire of the Fields of Punishment\u2014an eternal poker game,\nsitting up to his waist in boiling oil listening to opera music.

You\u2019ll be the greatest\nof all.\u201d\n\n\fI took one last look around my bedroom. I had a feeling I\u2019d never see it\nagain. Then I walked with my mother to the front door.\n\u201cLeaving so soon, punk?\u201d Gabe called after me. \u201cGood riddance.\u201d\nI had one last twinge of doubt. How could I turn down the perfect chance\nto take revenge on him?

Her own.\n\u201cThe meat loaf is coming right up, dear,\u201d she told Gabe. \u201cMeat loaf\nsurprise.\u201d\nShe looked at me, and winked.\n\n\fThe last thing I saw as the door swung closed was my mother staring at\nGabe, as if she were contemplating how he would look as a garden statue.\n\n\fW\n\nE WERE THE FIRST HEROES TO return alive to Half-Blood Hill since Luke,\n\nso of course everybody treated us as if we\u2019d won some reality-TV contest.\nAccording to camp tradition, we wore laurel wreaths to a big feast prepared\nin our honor, then led a procession down to the bonfire, where we got to\nburn the burial shrouds our cabins had made for us in our absence.\nAnnabeth\u2019s shroud was so beautiful\u2014gray silk with embroidered owls\u2014\nI told her it seemed a shame not to bury her in it. She punched me and told\nme to shut up.\nBeing the son of Poseidon, I didn\u2019t have any cabinmates, so the Ares\ncabin had volunteered to make my shroud. They\u2019d taken an old bedsheet and\npainted smiley faces with X\u2019ed-out eyes around the border, and the word\nLOSER painted really big in the middle.\nIt was fun to burn.\nAs Apollo\u2019s cabin led the sing-along and passed out s\u2019mores, I was\nsurrounded by my old Hermes cabinmates, Annabeth\u2019s friends from Athena,\nand Grover\u2019s satyr buddies, who were admiring the brand-new searcher\u2019s\nlicense he\u2019d received from the Council of Cloven Elders.

Well, huzzah for that. In other announcements,\nthere will be no canoe races this Saturday\u2026.\u201d\nI moved back into cabin three, but it didn\u2019t feel so lonely anymore. I had\nmy friends to train with during the day. At night, I lay awake and listened to\nthe sea, knowing my father was out there. Maybe he wasn\u2019t quite sure about\nme yet, maybe he hadn\u2019t even wanted me born, but he was watching. And so\nfar, he was proud of what I\u2019d done.\nAs for my mother, she had a chance at a new life. Her letter arrived a\nweek after I got back to camp. She told me Gabe had left mysteriously\u2014\ndisappeared off the face of the planet, in fact. She\u2019d reported him missing to\nthe police, but she had a funny feeling they would never find him.\nOn a completely unrelated subject, she\u2019d sold her first life-size concrete\nsculpture, entitled The Poker Player, to a collector, through an art gallery in\nSoho. She\u2019d gotten so much money for it, she\u2019d put a deposit down on a new\napartment and made a payment on her first semester\u2019s tuition at NYU. The\nSoho gallery was clamoring for more of her work, which they called \u201ca huge\nstep forward in super-ugly neorealism.\u201d\n\n\f\fBut don\u2019t worry, my mom wrote. I\u2019m done with sculpture. I\u2019ve disposed\nof that box of tools you left me. It\u2019s time for me to turn to writing.\nAt the bottom, she wrote a P.S.: Percy, I\u2019ve found a good private school\nhere in the city. I\u2019ve put a deposit down to hold you a spot, in case you want\nto enroll for seventh grade. You could live at home. But if you want to go\nyear-round at Half-Blood Hill, I\u2019ll understand.\nI folded the note carefully and set it on my bedside table. Every night\nbefore I went to sleep, I read it again, and I tried to decide how to answer\nher.\nOn the Fourth of July, the whole camp gathered at the beach for a fireworks\ndisplay by cabin nine. Being Hephaestus\u2019s kids, they weren\u2019t going to settle\nfor a few lame red-white-and-blue explosions. They\u2019d anchored a barge\noffshore and loaded it with rockets the size of Patriot missiles. According to\nAnnabeth, who\u2019d seen the show before, the blasts would be sequenced so\ntightly they\u2019d look like frames of animation across the sky. The finale was\nsupposed to be a couple of hundred-foot-tall Spartan warriors who would\ncrackle to life above the ocean, fight a battle, then explode into a million\ncolors.\nAs Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket, Grover showed up to\ntell us good-bye. He was dressed in his usual jeans and T-shirt and sneakers,\nbut in the last few weeks he\u2019d started to look older, almost high-school age.\nHis goatee had gotten thicker. He\u2019d put on weight. His horns had grown at\nleast an inch, so he now had to wear his rasta cap all the time to pass as\nhuman.\n\u201cI\u2019m off,\u201d he said. \u201cI just came to say\u2026well, you know.\u201d\nI tried to feel happy for him.

For the first time, I had the chance to\nlive with her for a whole year, without Gabe. I had a chance to be at home\nand knock around the city in my free time. I remembered what Annabeth had\nsaid so long ago on our quest: The real world is where the monsters are.\nThat\u2019s where you learn whether you\u2019re any good or not.\nI thought about the fate of Thalia, daughter of Zeus. I wondered how\nmany monsters would attack me if I left Half-Blood Hill. If I stayed in one\nplace for a whole school year, without Chiron or my friends around to help\nme, would my mother and I even survive until the next summer? That was\nassuming the spelling tests and five-paragraph essays didn\u2019t kill me. I\ndecided I\u2019d go down to the arena and do some sword practice.

Just train.\nI got to the sword-fighters arena and found that Luke had had the same\nidea. His gym bag was plopped at the edge of the stage. He was working\nsolo, whaling on battle dummies with a sword I\u2019d never seen before. It\nmust\u2019ve been a regular steel blade, because he was slashing the dummies\u2019\nheads right off, stabbing through their straw-stuffed guts. His orange\ncounselor\u2019s shirt was dripping with sweat. His expression was so intense, his\nlife might\u2019ve really been in danger. I watched, fascinated, as he\ndisemboweled the whole row of dummies, hacking off limbs and basically\nreducing them to a pile of straw and armor.\nThey were only dummies, but I still couldn\u2019t help being awed by Luke\u2019s\nskill.

The blade was two different types of metal\u2014one edge bronze, the\nother steel.\nLuke noticed me looking at it. \u201cOh, this? New toy. This is Backbiter.\u201d\n\u201cBackbiter?\u201d\nLuke turned the blade in the light so it glinted wickedly. \u201cOne side is\ncelestial bronze. The other is tempered steel.

What do you say we go down to the\nwoods one last time, look for something to fight?\u201d\nI don\u2019t know why I hesitated. I should\u2019ve felt relieved that Luke was\nbeing so friendly.

My willpower crumbled.\n\u201cSure,\u201d I decided. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nWe walked down to the woods and kicked around for some kind of\nmonster to fight, but it was too hot. All the monsters with any sense must\u2019ve\nbeen taking siestas in their nice cool caves.\nWe found a shady spot by the creek where I\u2019d broken Clarisse\u2019s spear\nduring my first capture the flag game. We sat on a big rock, drank our\nCokes, and watched the sunlight in the woods.\nAfter a while Luke said, \u201cYou miss being on a quest?\u201d\n\u201cWith monsters attacking me every three feet? Are you kidding?\u201d\nLuke raised an eyebrow.\n\n\f\u201cYeah, I miss it,\u201d I admitted. \u201cYou?\u201d\nA shadow passed over his face.\nI was used to hearing from the girls how good-looking Luke was, but at\nthe moment, he looked weary, and angry, and not at all handsome.

Then they\nthrew me one quest, and when I came back, it was like, \u2018Okay, ride\u2019s over.\nHave a nice life.\u2019\u201d\nHe crumpled his Coke can and threw it into the creek, which really\nshocked me. One of the first things you learn at Camp Half-Blood is: Don\u2019t\nlitter. You\u2019ll hear from the nymphs and the naiads. They\u2019ll get even. You\u2019ll\ncrawl into bed one night and find your sheets filled with centipedes and mud.\n\u201cThe heck with laurel wreaths,\u201d Luke said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to end up like\nthose dusty trophies in the Big House attic.\u201d\n\u201cYou make it sound like you\u2019re leaving.\u201d\nLuke gave me a twisted smile. \u201cOh, I\u2019m leaving, all right, Percy. I\nbrought you down here to say good-bye.\u201d\nHe snapped his fingers. A small fire burned a hole in the ground at my\nfeet. Out crawled something glistening black, about the size of my hand. A\nscorpion.\nI started to go for my pen.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Luke cautioned. \u201cPit scorpions can jump up to fifteen feet.\nIts stinger can pierce right through your clothes. You\u2019ll be dead in sixty\nseconds.\u201d\n\u201cLuke, what\u2014\u201d\nThen it hit me.\nYou will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.\n\u201cYou,\u201d I said.\nHe stood calmly and brushed off his jeans.\nThe scorpion paid him no attention. It kept its beady black eyes on me,\nclamping its pincers as it crawled onto my shoe.\n\n\f\u201cI saw a lot out there in the world, Percy,\u201d Luke said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you feel it\n\u2014the darkness gathering, the monsters growing stronger? Didn\u2019t you realize\nhow useless it all is? All the heroics\u2014being pawns of the gods. They\nshould\u2019ve been overthrown thousands of years ago, but they\u2019ve hung on,\nthanks to us half-bloods.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t believe this was happening.\n\u201cLuke\u2026you\u2019re talking about our parents,\u201d I said.\nHe laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to make me love them? Their precious\n\u2018Western civilization\u2019 is a disease, Percy. It\u2019s killing the world. The only way\nto stop it is to burn it to the ground, start over with something more honest.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re as crazy as Ares.\u201d\nHis eyes flared. \u201cAres is a fool. He never realized the true master he was\nserving. If I had time, Percy, I could explain. But I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t live\nthat long.\u201d\nThe scorpion crawled onto my pants leg.\n\n\fThere had to be a way out of this. I needed time to think.\n\u201cKronos,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s who you serve.\u201d\nThe air got colder.\n\u201cYou should be careful with names,\u201d Luke warned.\n\u201cKronos got you to steal the master bolt and the helm. He spoke to you\nin your dreams.\u201d\nLuke\u2019s eye twitched. \u201cHe spoke to you, too, Percy. You should\u2019ve\nlistened.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s brainwashing you, Luke.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. He showed me that my talents are being wasted. You\nknow what my quest was two years ago, Percy? My father, Hermes, wanted\nme to steal a golden apple from the Garden of the Hesperides and return it to\nOlympus. After all the training I\u2019d done, that was the best he could think\nup.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an easy quest,\u201d I said. \u201cHercules did it.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Luke said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the glory in repeating what others have\ndone?

I wanted to pull Olympus down\nstone by stone right then, but I bided my time. I began to dream of Kronos.\nHe convinced me to steal something worthwhile, something no hero had\never had the courage to take. When we went on that winter-solstice field trip,\nwhile the other campers were asleep, I snuck into the throne room and took\nZeus\u2019s master bolt right from his chair. Hades\u2019s helm of darkness, too. You\nwouldn\u2019t believe how easy it was. The Olympians are so arrogant; they\nnever dreamed someone would dare steal from them. Their security is\nhorrible. I was halfway across New Jersey before I heard the storms\nrumbling, and I knew they\u2019d discovered my theft.\u201d\nThe scorpion was sitting on my knee now, staring at me with its\nglittering eyes.

Zeus sent out his sons\nand daughters to find the stolen bolt\u2014Artemis, Apollo, my father, Hermes.\nBut it was Ares who caught me. I could have beaten him, but I wasn\u2019t\ncareful enough. He disarmed me, took the items of power, threatened to\nreturn them to Olympus and burn me alive. Then Kronos\u2019s voice came to me\nand told me what to say. I put the idea in Ares\u2019s head about a great war\n\n\fbetween the gods. I said all he had to do was hide the items away for a while\nand watch the others fight. Ares got a wicked gleam in his eyes. I knew he\nwas hooked. He let me go, and I returned to Olympus before anyone noticed\nmy absence.\u201d Luke drew his new sword. He ran his thumb down the flat of\nthe blade, as if he were hypnotized by its beauty. \u201cAfterward, the Lord of the\nTitans\u2026h-he punished me with nightmares. I swore not to fail again.

Knowing\ntoo much of your future is never a good thing.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just sit back and do nothing,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe will not sit back,\u201d Chiron promised. \u201cBut you must be careful.\nKronos wants you to come unraveled. He wants your life disrupted, your\nthoughts clouded with fear and anger. Do not give him what he wants. Train\npatiently. Your time will come.\u201d\n\u201cAssuming I live that long.\u201d\nChiron put his hand on my ankle. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to trust me, Percy. You\nwill live. But first you must decide your path for the coming year. I cannot\ntell you the right choice\u2026.\u201d I got the feeling that he had a very definite\nopinion, and it was taking all his willpower not to advise me. \u201cBut you must\ndecide whether to stay at Camp Half-Blood year-round, or return to the\n\n\fmortal world for seventh grade and be a summer camper. Think on that.\nWhen I get back from Olympus, you must tell me your decision.\u201d\nI wanted to protest. I wanted to ask him more questions. But his\nexpression told me there could be no more discussion; he had said as much\nas he could.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can,\u201d Chiron promised. \u201cArgus will watch over\nyou.\u201d\nHe glanced at Annabeth. \u201cOh, and, my dear\u2026whenever you\u2019re ready,\nthey\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d I asked.\nNobody answered.\nChiron rolled himself out of the room. I heard the wheels of his chair\nclunk carefully down the front steps, two at a time.\nAnnabeth studied the ice in my drink.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked her.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d She set the glass on the table. \u201cI\u2026just took your advice about\nsomething. You\u2026um\u2026need anything?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Help me up. I want to go outside.\u201d\n\u201cPercy, that isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d\nI slid my legs out of bed.

I didn\u2019t want to lie in bed like an invalid while\nLuke was out there planning to destroy the Western world.\nI managed a step forward. Then another, still leaning heavily on\nAnnabeth. Argus followed us outside, but he kept his distance.\nBy the time we reached the porch, my face was beaded with sweat. My\nstomach had twisted into knots. But I had managed to make it all the way to\nthe railing.\nIt was dusk. The camp looked completely deserted. The cabins were dark\nand the volleyball pit silent. No canoes cut the surface of the lake. Beyond\nthe woods and the strawberry fields, the Long Island Sound glittered in the\nlast light of the sun.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Annabeth asked me.\n\n\f\f\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nI told her I got the feeling Chiron wanted me to stay year-round, to put in\nmore individual training time, but I wasn\u2019t sure that\u2019s what I wanted. I\nadmitted I\u2019d feel bad about leaving her alone, though, with only Clarisse for\ncompany\u2026.\nAnnabeth pursed her lips, then said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m going home for the\nyear, Percy.\u201d\nI stared at her. \u201cYou mean, to your dad\u2019s?\u201d\nShe pointed toward the crest of Half-Blood Hill. Next to Thalia\u2019s pine\ntree, at the very edge of the camp\u2019s magical boundaries, a family stood\nsilhouetted\u2014two little children, a woman, and a tall man with blond hair.\nThey seemed to be waiting. The man was holding a backpack that looked\nlike the one Annabeth had gotten from Waterland in Denver.\n\u201cI wrote him a letter when we got back,\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cJust like you\nsuggested. I told him\u2026I was sorry. I\u2019d come home for the school year if he\nstill wanted me. He wrote back immediately. We decided\u2026we\u2019d give it\nanother try.\u201d\n\u201cThat took guts.\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cYou won\u2019t try anything stupid during the school year,\nwill you? At least\u2026not without sending me an Iris-message?\u201d\nI managed a smile. \u201cI won\u2019t go looking for trouble. I usually don\u2019t have\nto.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I get back next summer,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ll hunt down Luke. We\u2019ll\nask for a quest, but if we don\u2019t get approval, we\u2019ll sneak off and do it\nanyway. Agreed?\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a plan worthy of Athena.\u201d\nShe held out her hand. I shook it.\n\u201cTake care, Seaweed Brain,\u201d Annabeth told me. \u201cKeep your eyes open.\u201d\n\u201cYou too, Wise Girl.\u201d\nI watched her walk up the hill and join her family. She gave her father an\nawkward hug and looked back at the valley one last time. She touched\nThalia\u2019s pine tree, then allowed herself to be led over the crest and into the\nmortal world.\nFor the first time at camp, I felt truly alone.
